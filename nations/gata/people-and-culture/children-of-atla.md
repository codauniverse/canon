# Children of Atla

### Overview

Orphans and child refugees who fall into the custody of the state. Many across GATA were born into tumultuous times, so it was not uncommon for children who were born during the Dark Decade and Reconstruction to not know their families

&#x20;GATA’s policy of universally welcoming at-risk children has meant that to this day child refugees are frequently rescued from conflict zones or turn up at district gates.

Euphemistically referred to as GATA’s “children”, these wards of the state are endowed with citizenship which entitles them to System yield, their basic necessities, and they are sheltered and cared for in “Gardens”; communal housing watched over by System-employed caregivers and local volunteers.

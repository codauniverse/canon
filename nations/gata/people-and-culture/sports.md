# Sports

### **Gravita**

The most popular spectator sport in GATA. A contact sport played inside of an artificial gravity field. The Defenders defend from the core, a sphere housing the static field generator that maintains the modified gravitational envelope. The Offense attempts to score points by placing or propelling the ball into one of the receptacles on the core’s poles.

### **Darts**

Dart boards are sports equipment based on fairly widely paradigmed static field tech and powered by small Weaver reactors. A “dart” is a personal conveyance device in a form-factor similar to a surf board, somewhat resembling a thrown dart, that is used to convey its pilot with extreme speed and agility. Dart boards compromise between the static manifold surface area for generating thrust, dividing manifold surface area between the different flight surfaces to determine top speed versus acceleration and deceleration, and size for maneuverability.

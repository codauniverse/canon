# Greenwork

A matured street art medium that has spread around the world.

Made with a specially engineered fast-growing variant of the Manna flower that can be spread about like wild vines or grown in place like moss.

Greencans use a homebrew version of the much more expensive industrial plant growth-factor formulas in combination with Manna seeds. Greenwork is especially common in URSA.

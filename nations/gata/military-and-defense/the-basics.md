# The Basics

## Overview

From its inception, [Atla](../key-locations/atla.md) and [GATA](../) had always had a single formidable standing military. However, in the wake of [The Reconstruction](../../../overview/history/the-reconstruction.md), and the end of the [Existence Doctrine](existence-doctrine.md), the national military was officially dissolved.

Additionally, many of its most advanced weapons and technologies were decommissioned in accordance with [the AIC](../institutions/atlan-information-control-aic.md)’s interpretation of [NDA](../politics/new-dawn-accords.md) regulations. Many of GATA's most vocal critics had been skeptical that GATA would follow through with this self-constraint, however they did just that.

Today, GATA does not have a monolithic standing national military. Instead, Each of GATA’s major administrative bodies have armed branches to serve their mandates.

The [First Quorum](../politics/governance.md#the-first-quorum) directs [Angelis](angelis.md), an unrivalled martial public [enterprise](../enterprise/) based in Atla, in protecting GATA’s territorial interests across all of [Greater Atla](../politics/greater-atla.md), and beyond.

[The AIC](../institutions/atlan-information-control-aic.md) oversees [Collections](../law-and-order/collections.md), an armed enforcement branch for AIC law in accordance with the NDA, as well as [Border Patrol](../law-and-order/border-patrol.md), the border enforcement for GATA’s many [districts](../politics/districts.md).

The [Second Quorum](../politics/governance.md#the-second-quorum) directs the Reserve Protocol, which allows [District Representatives](../politics/governance.md#district-representative) to request the temporarily re-allocation of [Local Authority](../law-and-order/local-authority.md) personnel between districts. Reserve requests are more and more common and typically approved without issue.

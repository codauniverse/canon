# MAVERICKS

## Overview

Mavericks, or MAVs as they are known today, are the pinnacle of Angelis and GATA combat effectiveness. The best of the best, recruited from the ranks of the Guardians, and especially Rapid Response.

The defining attribute of a successful MAV is their ability to operate independently. The key to making it into the ranks of the MAVs is a prospective asset’s ability to tolerate and synergize with their cog implant.

MAV cog implants are installed directly in the brainstem, allowing the cog to enhance their reflexes, pain tolerance, and tactical and strategic thinking. Their cog implants can be paired with portable external compute that the MAV can position strategically or carry with them throughout the engagement, even further improving their combat performance and situational awareness.

## **Origins**

In the crucible of the Reconstruction era, the desperate need to tame a chaotic world gave rise to GATA’s "Existence Doctrine", an operational philosophy which permitted numerous secret programs to explore experimental technologies and methods.

One such program sought to discover the limit of human ability–the ultimate tactical operative. At its heart was an experimental gene therapy called "Clear". Designed to enhance the physical and mental capabilities of GATA forces, this therapy drastically improved reflexes, speed-of-thought, immunity, and healing capabilities.

However, it came at a cost: the recipients who could endure the therapy's side effects required an abnormally high intake of calories and water and were prone to overheating when sedentary.

Those who survived the transformation were termed "Unassisted Decisive Assets" (UDAs). Yet, they gained a more colloquial title — the "Mavericks."&#x20;

Singularly potent, with GATA’s superior weapons and equipment, a Maverick could replace an entire battalion, undertaking critical assignments, from asset retrieval to high-profile assassinations.

### **Clear Serum**

Classified. A series of experimental gene therapies developed to optimize effectiveness of GATA forces during Reconstruction. The exact formulation of clear was always in flux, tweaked based on data from a world-wide DNA catalog being collected at Atlan refugee camps. The Clear Project was the result of a charter assigned to a nascent ALTAR, and carried out by the team that created the Manna flower, led by Dr. Valter Koenig and his adopted daughter, the wunderkind, Dr. Hisako Koenig.

While it was created with the intention that it would lift up all of humanity, its applications were rapidly narrowed to military and intelligence operations. It is estimated that more than one hundred thousand Reconstruction veterans had received early Clear variants that were essentially just more powerful versions of Silver Manna. By the time the Clear program had reached its conclusion, less than a dozen doses were being administered per month, and its recipients and their assignments were heavily classified.

### Operational Limitations

Mavericks were not without their limitations. Mavericks thrived in solitary operations. Their training finely honed their predictive abilities, allowing them to seize control of any battlefield. They weren't just reactive forces, knocking down challenges as they appeared. Instead, they meticulously set up situations, dictating the flow of battles, creating and adjusting complex strategies on the fly. Friendlies on the battlefield heavily constrained their ability to assume “decisive supremacy” in the engagement.

While incredibly performant, these all-organic UDAs had a flaw in the eyes of GATA leadership. They were human; unpredictable, diverse in their methods, and capable of disobeying commands. It is believed that this very flaw was the reason that the original UDA program was discontinued, however, as with many covert programs, the truth of the matter remains elusive.

### An Obscured Past

When the original UDA program was disbanded, all records vanished from the General Record, presumably at the hands of ALTAR. However, whispers persist that that the UDA program was secretly responsible for numerous scandals in the Reconstruction’s history. And darker rumors abound – some say ALTAR keeps retired Mavericks in cryostasis, while others trade tales of Mavericks still operating in the shadows.

## **MAVs: The Modern Guardians of GATA**

Under the aegis of Angelis, the First Quorum approved the formation of an official MAVERICK division shortly following the Bright Mesa attack. The controversial history and mythic status of the original UDA program’s Mavericks was intentionally muddied by using the same name. MAVs can be identified on the battlefield by their white Combat Gear.

### Angelis' MAV Development Program

Angelis refined the “asset development” process using a more modest therapeutic regime, and inducing natural epigenetic changes with sound baths. Combined with cog implants to guide behavior and external hard-coded compute platforms that power their enhanced abilities, these "reliable assets" can be remotely regulated by throttling their external compute. While the cog’s LMNL architecture prevents remote manipulation, if the implant is damaged or somehow disabled the asset’s battlefield performance would drop precipitously. It is generally known that, while extremely effective, modern MAVs are not as singularly effective as the original UDAs.

The modern Mavericks, commonly referred to as MAVs, have become the bedrock of Angelis Rapid Response. Dropping from orbital “Watchtowers”, and using static field tech to accelerate their descent and soften their landing, MAVs can be deployed anywhere around the world in a matter of minutes. Monitoring gates, overseeing shipping routes, and rushing to emergencies in GATA-allied territories and homesteads, the Mavericks symbolize Atla's formidable decisive might. Their reputation for precision, unwavering persistence and mission success makes them a deterrent few dare challenge.

## **Mavericks of Note**

Known only among program administrators, personnel, and the elite soldiers themselves, some names rise above the rest as highly notable Mavericks.

Dante Newton, call sign Phobos, stands as a testament to the prowess of the original UDAs. With 115 global deployments to his name, he is best remembered for facing an entire Free Territory militia in North Texas to complete his mission successfully at the cost of his own life.

Captain Finneas Hughes of Angelis, the Maverick who died eliminating the infamous Butcher of Bright Mesa. His genetic blueprint forms the basis of Angelis' next-gen peacekeeper program.

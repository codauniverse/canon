# Existence Doctrine

## Overview

A strategic mindset assumed by GATA during The Dark Decade and The Reconstruction. The Existence Doctrine holds that all other interests and concerns are subordinate to human existence.

When humanity’s continued existence isn’t reasonably in question, GATA is free to consider other factors when making decisions, especially rights, regulations and human flourishing.

***

## History

The Existence Doctrine gave GATA exhaustive flexibility and emergency powers, permitting leadership to act decisively and utilize the full arsenal of technologies, weapons, and human resources at their disposal. Some of the most incredible feats of science and engineering were accomplished during this period. Many reported technologies seen during the Existence Doctrine’s time were developed by ALTAR special programs, and have not been seen in action since. Some since-paradigmed technology matches eye-witness accounts from the Dark Decade and Reconstruction, giving historians some sense of just how early some of GATA’s most transformative technologies were really developed.

## Controversy

Critics pointed out the irony that GATA was ostensibly founded on the principals of the New Dawn Accords while simultaneously operating under a different set of rules. This tension led to a political swell that was reinforced by external pressure from its partner states, eventually resulting in the Morning Light Summit.

### The End of the Existence Doctrine

Since the end of the Reconstruction, the Existence Doctrine has no longer been in effect in GATA, meaning that other concerns can drive GATA decision making.

As a result, many of the technologies and machinery used during The Reconstruction are no longer permitted for use within GATA.&#x20;

Even still, the specter of its mythologized “secret advanced technology” derived from the mysterious [Found Objects](../history/found-objects.md) has proven immensely useful for GATA in projecting its power politically without having to reveal its true capabilities.

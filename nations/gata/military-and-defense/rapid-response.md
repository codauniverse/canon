## Overview

Rapid Response are elite first responder units. They typically operate in teams of 3-5 with complementary skills and are deployed from orbit in hard-landing pods called an Aegis, the same deployment method as Mavericks. New Mavericks are often recruited from the ranks of Rapid Response.

Rapid Response is identifiable by their red Gear, often in the small to mid-size range. Their gear emphasizes adaptability and maneuverability, designed to withstand the most extreme conditions, and are generally light on weapons and heavy on utility.

# ALTAR

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/altar.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>ALTAR's secretive high council.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

Deep within the foundation of Atla, beneath the swirling currents of the Atlantic, lies the ALTAR complex – the beating heart of the most clandestine institution in GATA.

By exploring a myriad of new techniques and scientific principles, ALTAR's groundbreaking work produces a diverse ecology of technologies.

This plurality of technological primitives helps the AIC maintain the NDA’s doctrine of 'mutual incompatibility', ensuring each district's technological paradigm is distinct.

In the world of Atla and GATA, while many secrets lurk beneath the surface, the influence of ALTAR remains undeniable.

## **History**

Established concurrently with the founding of Atla in 2060, ALTAR's prime directive has always been the safeguarding and scrutiny of the mysterious "Found Objects."

Collected by the Joint Atlantic Command (JAC) in the tumultuous early days of the Dark Decade, for most people around the world these objects remain shrouded in apocryphal myth.

The origins of these 67 objects, of which 21 are mere fragments, remain uncertain, though many speculate an extraterrestrial connection.

Spanning a diverse size range from a mere 3cm to an imposing 155m, they have, for millennia been secretly coveted by black budget operations, governments, empires, and religions.

## **GATA’s Innovation Engine**

Boasting a recruitment roster that includes the most brilliant minds from not just GATA, but also from the recognized territories of AU, Aryabat, Japan, and URSA, ALTAR is a hive of innovation.

Researchers, usually working solitarily or in compact teams, delve into the mysteries of the objects. If their work meets the safety standards set by the Atlan Innovation Control (AIC), they're rewarded with enterprise licenses, granting them the freedom to transform their discoveries into cutting-edge technologies or license them to other legal enterprises.

## **Leadership**

Idle whispers and speculations about ALTAR's leadership permeate the corridors of Atla, and beyond.

Its secretive nature is a legacy of compartmentalized programs predating the Dark Decade, fuels numerous conspiracy theories.&#x20;

Some claim the leadership is not of this world; others go so far as to suggest that they might have even caused the Dark Decade themselves. However, this wild speculation remains unverified.

In truth, ALTAR is a small council of undisclosed scientists, industrialists and military leadership who serve 10-year terms bound within the confines of the deep-ocean ALTAR complex. Some confident speculation can be made about past and present appointments, however no official confirmation has ever been provided.

At any given time, ALTAR leadership has only one Speaker, who is responsible for all communications between ALTAR and GATA leadership (generally only the First Quorum, with few exceptions).

***

## Operation

ALTAR leadership works closely with the First Quorum, and follows strict protocols in all such interactions so as to preserve dangerous secrets while also providing the First Quorum with actionable information, recommendations, and abstracted choices.

In the event that dangerous secret information must be revealed to the First Quorum in order to facilitate a decision, one Quorum member will be required to go to the ALTAR complex in person where they will meet with The Speaker, learn the information, make a decision on behalf of the First Quorum, and remain quarantined within the ALTAR complex for up to 10 years, based on the sensitivity of the information.

The policy is that First Quorum member considered most qualified for membership on ALTAR’s council would be asked to do this, creating a natural opportunity to freshen the council and begin the councilor's transition into a position in ALTAR.

## Overview

Wallrunners, or simply “runners”. Specialized [smugglers](smugglers.md) or illegal [operators](../enterprise/operators.md) who use various methods to breach [GATA](../)’s [Field Walls](../borders-and-travel/field-walls.md) and make it into a [district](../politics/districts.md)'s interior.

Wallrunners are named for the most common breaching method; running really fast. Wallrunners have to contend with Field Walls, [Border Patrol](../law-and-order/border-patrol.md) border guards and their jelly rounds, physical obstacles, and other specialized defensive measures.

## Wallrunning

Many wallrunners employ Sprint Gear, [wearable gear](../../../overview/science-and-tech/gear.md) or prosthetics that allow them to achieve superhuman speed and agility while also relying heavily on strategy, deception and misdirection.

Outside of the district walls, wallrunners contend with the highly capable Border Patrol, but once they breach the district interior tracking them falls to the [Local Authority](../law-and-order/local-authority.md), who are typically far less capable to address skilled runners.

### Escalation with Authorities

In recent years, more lethal equipment has been approved by [the Second Quorum](../politics/governance.md#the-second-quorum) as Wallrunning has contributed significantly to an increase in tech crime across the most affected districts.

In response to this, much more advanced Sprint Gear has been developed, in a constant escalatory battle between GATA and the [criminal syndicates](syndicates.md) who incentivize wallrunning activity.

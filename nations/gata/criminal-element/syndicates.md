# Syndicates

### Hundred Hands

The largest criminal syndicate in the world. Known to operate in all corners, the Hundred Hands are a network of secretive illegal enterprises and shot callers united in one goal; to circumvent all walls, pick all locks, and "take all that can be taken".

Feared by local gangs and upstart crime bosses, because once you reach a certain size you are faced with a simple choice; either join the Hundred Hands, or prepare for war. A handful of newer syndicates have fought bloody wars to earn an equilibrium with the Hands, however the vast majority who challenge them are wiped out or consumed.

### The River Syndicate

The River syndicate is the only known supplier of Red manna.

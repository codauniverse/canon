# Field Walls

The district boundaries are marked by contiguous walls of ghostly light that stretch into the sky. GATA-built emitters are placed at regular distances and can detect any object passing through the walls. Gate Patrol will arrive shortly thereafter, and with their UniMaPrs (‘mappers’ for short) they can detect and trace just about anything.

Refugees and smugglers are given over to GATA custody, while incidents involving district citizens are typically left to district governments to address. If a district fails to enforce their borders effectively, their yield may decrease or their paradigm’s development may be deprioritized.

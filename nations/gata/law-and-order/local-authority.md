# Local Authority

## Overview

The Local Authority (or just “Authority”) is the official designation in GATA for local law enforcement, which is overseen by local governments of their districts, who themselves answer to the Second Quorum. There are Atlan Authority regulations that dictate the general operational principles and procedures for the Local Authority, however the details of their enforcement styles and cultures varies widely between districts.

## Origins

Originating from local gangs and community defence organizations. Local authority doesn't share any meaningful lineage with the police forces of the Old World and their institutional histories.&#x20;

When GATA incorporates new districts, the extant sources of law and order in those communities are deputized by their provisional governments and form the basis of a new, legitimized enforcement arm. Historically, the Local Authority of a district is generally formed from community defence brigades and gangs that are compatible with the laws and regulations of GATA.

## Operation

The decentralized nature of the Local Authority allows each district to tailor law enforcement strategies according to their unique societal and technological paradigms. Local Authorities overseen by the local government and equipped with ample resources by the Second Quorum.

Local Authorities can request limited access to certain advanced technologies if their District Representative can bend the ear of the AIC Liason for Gate Patrol or Collections resources, or rally the Second Quorum to sign an appeal to the First Quorum for Angelis support, a much rarer affordance.

The Local Authority's jurisdiction ends at the district's Gate and Field Wall. Transgate crime requires coordination with Gate Patrol.&#x20;

Some tension tends to exist between Gate Patrol and the Local Authority because of the special paradigm enjoyed by Gate Patrol, affording them access to more advanced technology and better intelligence via AIC-related keys.

### Cross-district Coordination

The Local Authority can use The System to coordinate operations and share information with Local Authorities in other districts for matters concerning cross-district crimes or larger security threats, but their information sharing is limited by the WPP Act.

## Involvement in Gray Zones

The Local Authority doesn’t have jurisdiction within Grey Zones inside their territory, however it is not uncommon for people inside Grey Zones to request assistance of authorities, which is often provided without issue.

In the event that crime in Grey Zones involves district citizens or breaches of NDA law, the Local Authority is not authorized under GATA law to intervene, however they may choose to request the assistance of Angelis.

## Reserve Protocol

A district's Second Quorum representative can request that other districts temporarily provide additional personnel and material support support from other districts.

Transferred personnel receive temporary gate keys, and have access to whatever technology is paradigmed in the district to which they are deployed.

## Disaster Response

The Local Authority plays an important role in emergency response and disaster management, working under the direction of their local government.

Angelis Rapid Response is typically the first responder for the most serious emergencies, but the local authority are the primary support and, after the initial stages, transition into taking the lead over the medium/long term recovery project.

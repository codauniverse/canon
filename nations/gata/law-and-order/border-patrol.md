# Border Patrol

Border Patrol consists of Gate personnel and inspectors, intelligence operatives, embedded Angelis officers, specially trained border guards and support combat units.

Border Patrol is meant to utilize non-lethal means against targets, however they are equipped for armed resistance and deaths do occur. Border guards typically utilize non-lethal jelly rounds to immobilize targets.

## Borders & Smuggling

Of particular concern to Border Patrol are wallrunners, specialized smugglers and illegal operators who use various methods to breach the Field Walls and make it into the district interior, where tracking them becomes much more difficult and falls to the Local Authority.

A strong rivalry has developed between Border Patrol and wallrunners, sometimes resulting in needless provocation and overzealous pursuit.

In recent years, more lethal equipment has been approved by the Second Quorum as wallrunning has contributed significantly to an increase in tech-related crime across the most affected districts.

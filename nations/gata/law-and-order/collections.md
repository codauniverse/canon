### **Overview**

One of the enforcement branches of the [AIC](../institutions/atlan-information-control.md), along with [Border Patrol](gate-patrol.md). Collections is a bureau dedicated to the tracking and recovery of illegal technology, and the apprehension of those who exploit it.

***

### Collectors

Collections field agents are called Collectors, specially trained investigators and operators who typically work undercover, and are deployed all around the world, from [Greater Atla](../politics/greater-atla.md) and its partner states, to [Gray Zones](../politics/gray-zones.md) and the [Free Territories](../../free-territories/).

### Collections at District Gates

Every [Gate](../borders-and-travel/gates.md) in GATA has a Collections Desk, an office available to Collectors who need access to resources and support, and to members of the public who wish to report or surrender [illegal technology](tech-regulation.md) or other [Old World](../../../overview/history/the-old-world.md) contraband.

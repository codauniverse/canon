# Exile

One of the most severe punishments in GATA. Local governments have the authority to exile citizens, revoking their Gate keys, making the district inaccessible to them. This does not revoke their citizenship keys, but it does effectively render the exiled individual displaced.

If they have keys to other districts, they will have to find their way there without use of their former districtâ€™s resources, which can be a very challenging undertaking if the destination district is far away.

Most exiles can be found living as disaffected sovereigns in the Free Territories.

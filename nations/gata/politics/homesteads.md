# Homesteads

Dotted through the landscape are the many homesteads maintained by [GATA](../) citizens who choose to live outside of the security and constraints of a district.

While citizens who live in homesteads are not entitled to [yield](yield.md) from the[ districts](districts.md), aid and support are provided by GATA, especially in emergencies.

In some cases, districts will allocate a portion of their yield to nearby homesteads, making sometimes-dangerous shipments of food, medicine and other resources into contested territory where they may encounter [Free Territory](../../free-territories/) militias and criminal piracy often orchestrated by [syndicates](../criminal-element/syndicates.md).

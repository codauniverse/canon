# Greater Atla

Greater Atla refers to the entire geographic domain of [GATA](../) and “all the lands under the light of The New Dawn.” Greater Atla encompasses [districts](districts.md), cities, townships and smaller [homesteads](homesteads.md), as well as [enterprise](../enterprise/) and military facilities, and other operations.

[Gray Zones](gray-zones.md) are technically inside of Greater Atla, however the people who lived there during [Reconstruction](../../../overview/history/the-reconstruction.md) established physical borders and declared sovereignty, rejecting GATA citizenship, and the people living there continue to assert those rights, which GATA is obliged to respect under its law.

Greater Atla also includes all signatories of the [New Dawn Accords](new-dawn-accords.md), however often when people mention “Greater Atla” they are just referring to the wider territory of GATA proper.

All of Greater Atla is under the vigilant protection of the [First Quorum](governance.md#the-first-quorum)’s [Angelis](../military-and-defense/angelis.md), monitoring from Earth orbit and deploying units around the world, including GATA’s partner states.

# New Dawn Accords

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/newdawnaccords.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The New Dawn Accords being signed by a local government.</p></figcaption></figure>

The New Dawn Accords (NDA) are a set of agreements and principles introduced by [GATA ](../)at the close of the Dark Decade. The NDA was pursued following the successful implementation, and remarkable performance of "[The System](the-system.md)" within Atla, its founding [district](districts.md). The document was written by a special working group from [Atlan Information Control (AIC)](../institutions/atlan-information-control.md), and is based on the [New Dawn Declaration](../history/new-dawn-declaration.md) that birthed Atla as a political entity.

The NDA stipulates foundational principles for a stable, prosperous human civilization. These range from the more abstract and philosophical, to specific processes and restrictions. The purpose of the NDA is to outline a system for key infrastructure that ensures all signatories maintain autonomy while being mutually compatible with GATA and each other.

While in some ways the NDA and The System are permissive with how day-to-day life is conducted by local governments, it is extremely restrictive regarding the use of power, technology and information, and it precisely describes how material support from The System's other signatories will be throttled based on a jurisdiction's adherence to the accords.

Among the many regulations outlined in the New Dawn Accords, some are particularly consequential on everyday life in fully NDA-compliant jurisdictions like districts. For example:&#x20;

* All technology must be "scrutible", meaning its components must be readily visible or accessible, and when scanned, must be recognized on the General Record.
* Dense population centers (such as districts) must have tightly enforced crossings (known as Gates).
* Each district must adhere to their own technological paradigms which determine the frequencies, materials and design patterns that are permitted within that district.&#x20;
* The living standard of a district's citizens must be maintained at the cost of a district's surplus Yield, aligning incentives with private enterprise.

The ultimate stated goal of the document is the eventual unification of Earth into one domain, in order to set the stage for humanity spreading to other worlds by the end of the 22nd century.

### **Signatories**

* Atla
* GATA (Current & pending districts)
* Aryabat
* African Union
* New Imperial Japan

### **Ongoing Developments**

Pressure continues to mount on URSA to sign the NDA. URSA resists, as signing would initiate a timeline of obligations that would force them to implement GATA's Systema-developed System Nodes, and they insist their own long-in-development implementation of The System will be ready soon.

### History

Beginning with population centers formed around some of its largest refugee camps, Atla offered the local leadership the opportunity to join their grand political project; the Greater Atlan Territorial Alliance. Over the following years, these camps would become the first districts aside from Atla, built up by the nascent GATA, and fully-compliant with NDA.

It was in these young districts where The System was tested and iterated. It wasn't long before the&#x20;

## The Morning Light Summit

In 2073, after experiencing years of impressive development, GATA hosted the Morning Light Summit and extended its first invitations to the remaining super-states of the world to adopt The System and the [New Dawn Accords](new-dawn-accords.md).

The NDA was designed to allow other states to share in the abundance and benefits that The System offered. However, the underlying message of the NDA was clear: make the choice to join now, or potentially lose the opportunity to choose later.

### Adoption of the New Dawn Accords

The Morning Light Summits were marked by significant contention from [URSA](../../ursa/) and [New Imperial Japan](../../new-imperial-japan/). [Aryabat](../../aryabat/) expressed enthusiasm for adopting the accords fairly early.

[The African Union](../../african-union/)â€™s unique treaties signed with a formative Atla during the Dark Decade allowed it some leverage in the conditions of its signing, and [with some incident](../../african-union/history/the-broken-dawn-revolt.md) ultimately led to the development of its own version of The System that complies with the NDA, separate from the builds produced by Systema.

URSA has spent much of the recent past attempting to negotiate a similar arrangement, however it lacks sufficient leverage to make this demand from GATA, as it appears from the outside URSA is destined to collapse under the weight of political corruption.

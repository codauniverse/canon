# Paradigms

A paradigm is a [district](districts.md)'s unique technological allowances. Within a district's paradigm, legal technology is considered 'blue' or ‘soft’, and illegal tech as ‘red’ or ‘hard’.

The development of a district's paradigm is gradual and adaptive, designed by expert working groups at [the AIC](../institutions/atlan-information-control-aic.md) with input from district representatives from the [Second Quorum](governance.md#the-second-quorum), and approved by the [First Quorum](governance.md#the-first-quorum).

A district's paradigm is directly informed by the districts activity recorded on [The System](the-system.md), its adherence to the [New Dawn Accords](new-dawn-accords.md)’ regulations, its enforcement of border security, and its internal political stability.

For instance, a newly incorporated district might start with modest technological allowances while [Collections](../law-and-order/collections.md) works to clear the district of red tech.&#x20;

After protracted good standing within The System, a district’s paradigm is allowed to expand in response to the citizenry’s needs and desires, ensuring that, over time, districts achieve both a distinct and comprehensive infrastructure.

## **Differences Between Paradigms**

Paradigms can vary wildly between districts. The progression of a district’s paradigm is not strictly linear, and is determined by the needs and use of technology within a district, as well as the standing of the district within The System.

[Atla](../key-locations/atla.md), the Capitol District of [GATA](../), boasts the most sophisticated paradigm, however it is also the smallest and most exclusive district. But even Atla, with all its spectacular advancements, might lack specific technologies present in a relatively nascent district with a pressing need for that technology.

This non-linear development means two districts with similar standing and incorporation dates often possess wildly different industrial and technological profiles, enabling lifestyles that are unique to a given district.

## **Paradigm Sanctions:**

Though uncommon, there have been instances of GATA tightening paradigms, especially in response to emergencies and severe, systemic breaches of the [New Dawn Accords](new-dawn-accords.md).

These sanctions are determined by the AIC and carried out by [Systema](../enterprise/systema.md), who can remotely update a district’s [System Node(s)](the-system.md#system-nodes) from its [Lunar](../key-locations/luna.md) headquarters.

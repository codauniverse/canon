# The New Dawn Accords

## Overview

The New Dawn Accords are a set of agreements and principles introduced by [GATA ](../)early in [The Reconstruction](../../../overview/history/the-reconstruction.md) following the successful implementation and remarkable results of "[The System](the-system.md)" within Atla, its founding [district](districts.md).

Beginning with population centers formed around some of its largest refugee camps, Atla offered the local leadership the opportunity to join a new, grand political project within the Greater Atlan Territorial Alliance. Over the following years, these camps would become the first new districts.

## The Morning Light Summit

In 2073, after experiencing years of impressive development, GATA hosted the Morning Light Summit and extended its first invitations to the remaining super-states of the world to adopt The System and the [New Dawn Accords](the-new-dawn-accords.md).

The NDA was designed to allow other states to share in the abundance and benefits that The System offered. However, the underlying message of the NDA was clear: make the choice to join now, or potentially lose the opportunity to choose later.

### Adoption of the New Dawn Accords

The introduction of the New Dawn Accords and the proposal to extend The System's reach was met with significant contention from [URSA](../../ursa/) and [New Imperial Japan](../../new-imperial-japan/). [Aryabat](../../aryabat/) expressed enthusiasm for adopting the accords fairly early.

[The African Union](../../african-union/)â€™s unique treaties with GATA that carried over from its founding days allowed it some leverage in the conditions of its signing, and [with some incident](../../african-union/history/the-broken-dawn-revolt.md) ultimately led to the development of its own version of The System that complies with the NDA, separate from the builds produced by Systema.

URSA has spent much of the recent past attempting to negotiate a similar arrangement, however it lacks sufficient leverage to make this demand.

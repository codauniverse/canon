## **Overview**

Keys are a fundamental component of The System and the New Dawn Accords. Keys are digital signatures that bestow specific privileges on their holder. Every key has its own rules, and while many keys can be bought, or traded, others can only be earned or assigned, and some can also be revoked.

Keys are an integral part of every-day life inside of districts, and to a wide but less ubiquitous extent, across Greater Atla and in NDA-compliant states. Keys are how you access your living spaces, your places of work, and the districts themselves. Keys grant you access to information and organizations, or to exclusive goods and services.&#x20;

The most valuable keys are System-level keys; illegal keys that aren't destroyed during a district's transition from System Testnet. Every district is believed to have some, even Atla.

A key's cryptographic signature can be encoded in many different form-factors, whether it's in digital storage on data sticks, or embedded in the structure of physical objects, or even stored in the mind and usable only through linking with systems.

## **Privileges**

Privileges are associated with keys. Privileges can be transferrable or non-transferrable, depending on the key.

## **Types of Keys**

### Citizenship Keys

Citizenship keys are bestowed to GATA citizens at birth. Citizenship cannot be revoked. All System activity is authenticated with Citizenship keys, meaning if you don’t have citizenship, you can’t use the System.

### **Gate Keys**

### **System Keys**

### **Private Keys**

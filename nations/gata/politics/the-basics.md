# The Basics

## Overview

[GATA](../) is an expansive domain centered on its Atlantic capitol, [Atla](../key-locations/atla.md). Its land encompasses Eastern North America, Western and Central Europe, North Africa, and Northern Central America.

GATA's territory can be divided into [districts](districts.md) which receive the full support of [The System](the-system.md), and [Greater Atla](greater-atla.md), which describes all of the land that is claimed by GATA.

Greater Atla includes vast swaths of land dotted with districts, cities, townships and smaller [homesteads](homesteads.md), as well as [enterprise](../enterprise/) and military facilities, and other operations.

# Yield

## Overview

Yield is a periodic distribution of resources and benefits derived from the collective economic and industrial activities across the regions governed by [The System](the-system.md).

All economic and industrial activity across [GATA](../) feeds into The System, and Yield is what comes back, distributed according to The Systemâ€™s [hard-coded](../../../overview/science-and-tech/hard-code.md) logic.

Yield represents a tangible return on the collective efforts and compliance of districts that meet the [NDA](the-new-dawn-accords.md)'s requirements and regulations.

Yield consists of [keys](keys.md), funds, and physical shipments to be distributed by local governments, and some direct airdrops to citizens and [enterprises](../enterprise/).

## **Yield Calculation**

The System uses its comprehensive insight into district activity to calculate Yield. This includes monitoring resource needs, surplus production, economic transactions, and civic engagement.

Yield is then modulated based on district performance in key metrics, governance quality, and adherence to the New Dawn Accords (NDA) provided from direct reporting about [crime](../criminal-element/), [industry](../enterprise/), and [education](../people-and-culture/education.md), by government, institutions, and enterprise.

This serves as an incentive for districts to continually improve and align with GATA's broader goals.

### **Yield Economics**

#### **Resource Redistribution:**

* The System reallocates surplus resources from more productive districts to those with deficits, providing a mechanism to balance supply and demand across many metrics.
* This redistribution helps in stabilizing the economy across GATA, smoothing out regional disparities, and elevating quality of life across [Greater Atla](greater-atla.md), and especially within districts.

#### **Incentive Structures:**

* Districts are incentivized to improve efficiency and governance to increase their Yield.
* Active civic participation is rewarded, fostering a sense of community and responsibility.

#### **Creating Value:**

* By optimizing resource allocation and reducing waste, The System generates additional value.
* Surpluses and efficiencies encourage investment in new technologies and industries, driving economic growth.
* In more mature districts, compounded efficiencies over time reduce the need for active labor, allowing for a focus on innovation and higher-order economic activities, or simple recreation.

#### **Sustainability and Scalability:**

* The System's algorithms adapt to changing economic conditions, ensuring long-term sustainability.
* This model can be scaled up as GATA expands, incorporating new districts and economies into the fold.

# New Dawn Declaration

The first draft of the New Dawn Declaration was circulated among the Joint-Atlantic Command's civilian population on November 2, 2056. While the document was a unique articulation of political, legal and technological philosophy, it contained many ideas that had been widely supported by domain experts before The Crash, but which the political order had failed to implement sufficiently to prevent catastrophe. Today, the New Dawn Declaration is considered by many to mark the beginning of the end of the Dark Decade.

The New Dawn Declaration was a political treatise on decentralization, compartmentalization, end-to-end encryption, wireless technology, and application-specific hardware, implicating them as foundational to creating a sound, secure, and prosperous global civilization.

The document would go on to inspire the New Dawn Accords, an international agreement binding signatories to a set of principles, rules and restrictions. Where the New Dawn Declaration is the founding document of Atla, the New Dawn Accords are the founding document of the Greater Atlan Territorial Alliance (GATA).

# New Dawn Declaration

The New Dawn Declaration was a political treatise on decentralization, compartmentalization, end-to-end encryption, wireless technology, and application-specific hardware, implicating them as foundational to creating a sound, secure, and prosperous global civilization.

## History

Inspired by The Big Talk where Joint-Atlantic Command (JAC) leadership, under the Existence Doctrine, resolved to disclose a significant amount of classified information to JAC civilians. The revelations spurred an infectious spirit of hope that was ultimately crystalized into the New Dawn Declaration. The first draft was circulated among the JAC's civilian population on November 2, 2056.

While the document was a unique composite of political, legal and technological philosophy, it contained many ideas that had been widely supported by domain experts prior to The Crash, but which the old political order had failed to implement sufficiently to prevent catastrophe.

## Impact

Today, the New Dawn Declaration is considered by many to mark "the beginning of the end" of the Dark Decade. It marks the founding of Atla, GATA's future capitol, and, along with Asimovian architecture, catalyzed the creation of The System.

The document later went on to inspire the New Dawn Accords, an international agreement binding signatories to a set of principles, rules and restrictions. Where the New Dawn Declaration is the founding document of Atla, the New Dawn Accords are the founding document of the Greater Atlan Territorial Alliance (GATA).

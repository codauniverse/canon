# The Bright Mesa Attack

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/83.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

Bright Mesa was a Free City located in the Nevada desert in what used to be the Neutral Zone between Atla-assisted territories to the West and the Texan Empire to the East.

***

### History

Beginning as an Atla-supported refugee camp during the last years of the Dark Decade. Bright Mesa took its name both from the many striking mesas that surrounded the camp, and its many strings of lights powered by solar in a time when most people had no electricity.

The founders of Bright were space and military engineers, and in the early months of the Dark Decade had transported a large stockpile of solar and fabricators. They would create their own micro-supply-chain and build up infrastructure in a secluded and fortified valley surrounded by mesas.

The encampment steadily grew until, by the time of The Reconstruction, its favelas had woven between and carved into the nearby mesas.

#### Relations with GATA

Because it originated in the same spirit as Atla, and served as the primary Atla-supported refugee camp in the region during the Dark Decade, assistance from the recently constituted GATA had always been forthcoming. Bright Mesa’s government voluntarily enforced GATA’s New Dawn Regulations, and ran their own, separate build of The System. In many ways, Bright was already a district, even though it remained independent.

But with a steady stream of refugees from the South and East, by the end of The Reconstruction its culture had taken on a character that was much more sympathetic to the beliefs of the Freedom movement. Growing representation by Sovereigns and the neo-luddite Eidetics continued to influence the local politics until Bright held a referendum to decide its destiny in 2114.

### Bright Mesa's Referendum

With tensions between GATA and the Free Territories having escalated in the region over the years, something had to give. The Texan Empire was accused of harboring organized crime syndicates that would target GATA homesteads and citizens when they enter the neutral territory outside of Bright. There was a push from Atla to solidify their hold on Bright in response to this flagrant contravention of a standing agreement that Bright Mesa was to remain neutral. In truth, Bright Mesa was bound to GATA in too many ways to ever turn its back, but the leadership had to address the vocal dissent. A referendum was held, and given the choice between GATA and independence, the people of Bright Mesa chose GATA with a decisive 65% voting to join, versus 22% for Independence (with 13% undecided).

### The Bright Mesa Attack

After the certification of the vote, technical and diplomatic delegations were sent from GATA to activate Bright’s System and celebrate Bright’s districthood. The technical delegation arrived in advance and prepared Bright’s System Node, as well as its field wall emitters.

On the day of the Activation Ceremony, the diplomatic delegation arrived, and amongst them, many prominent citizens of GATA who had some ties to Bright Mesa. A day of celebration ensued, featuring performances, speeches, games, and cheer.

However, as the day progressed, small pockets of protest steadily began to boil over as Activation neared.&#x20;

Immediately following Activation, nuclear explosions devastated Bright Mesa, killing many thousands and most of the Atlan delegation that was sent to oversee and celebrate Bright’s induction into GATA.

The terrorist organization the CURE claimed responsibility for the attack. Confidence in GATA’s protection in the region was shaken and the profile of the CURE reached a global scale.

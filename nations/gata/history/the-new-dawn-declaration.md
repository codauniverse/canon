# The New Dawn Declaration

### **Overview**

The first draft of the New Dawn Declaration was circulated among the Atlan civilian population on November 2, 2062. While the document was a unique articulation of political, legal and technological philosophy, it contained many ideas that had been widely supported by domain experts before The Crash, but which the political order had failed to implement sufficiently to prevent catastrophe. The New Dawn Declaration implicated decentralization, compartmentalization, end-to-end encryption, air-gapping, and the push to move to ASIC hardware, as being foundational to creating a sound, secure, and prosperous global civilization.

### **Signatories**

* Atla
* GATA (Original Refugee Cities)
* Aryabat
* African Union
* New Imperial Japan

### **Ongoing Developments**

The major political project of the moment relating to the NDA is to finally get URSA to sign the accords and join the domain of Greater Atla.

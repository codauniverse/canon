# The New Dawn Declaration

### **Overview**

The first draft of the New Dawn Declaration was circulated among the Atlan civilian population on November 2, 2062. While the document was a unique articulation of political, legal and technological philosophy, it contained many ideas that had been widely supported by domain experts before The Crash, but which the political order had failed to implement sufficiently to prevent catastrophe.&#x20;

The New Dawn Declaration was a political treatise on decentralization, compartmentalization, end-to-end encryption, wireless technology, and application-specific hardware, implicating them as foundational to creating a sound, secure, and prosperous global civilization.

# The Basics

### Overview

The government of Sol is minimal. Its main responsibility, beyond the well-being of its citizens, is providing oversight and authorization for the activities of its primary enterprise, Helios.

The Sol government's mandate notably includes securing the heliosphere against unlawful conduct. Sol's jurisdiction spans from the Dark Side of the Moon to the edge of the heliosphere, encompassing Gemini City and the interplanetary space of the solar system beyond. Helios operatives, mainly conduits based in Gemini City, work in coordination with Rangers to secure and assist remote platforms.

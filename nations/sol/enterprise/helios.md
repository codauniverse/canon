# Helios

### Overview

Helios is Sol’s primary military enterprise, with roughly the same relationship to Sol as Angelis has with GATA. Sol government provides oversight and authorization for Helios activity, with its mandate to secure the heliosphere against unlawful conduct. Sol’s jurisdiction extends outward from the Dark Side of the Moon to the edge of the heliosphere, including Gemini City.

Most Helios operatives are conduits based in Gemini City, linking with remote platforms, however Rangers are assigned to outposts across the solar system to protect scientific missions, or assist rockfishers in crisis.

GATA often turns to Sol and Helios for assistance in intelligence gathering as well as space-based challenges. In effect, Sol and Helios function as extensions of GATA.

# Governance

### Overview

New Imperial Japan operates under a hereditary monarchy. The Emperor or Empress, while primarily a ceremonial figurehead, wields significant moral and legal authority and is supported by the Imperial Council, comprising nobles, technocrats, and influential family representatives. This council plays a pivotal role in shaping policies and advising the monarch.

The day-to-day governance is managed by a Prime Minister, appointed by the Emperor/Empress, and a cabinet of Ministers overseeing its various sectors. The Prime Minister works closely the other Ministers to ensure the longevity and relative independence of the Empire. The Assembly, staffed with experts across many fields, collaborates closely with the government, ensuring that New Imperial Japan remains competitive in the global technological landscape.

Diplomatically, New Imperial Japan favors non-interventionism and seeks to maintain a low profile in global politics, but is not averse to forging strategic alliances and partnerships that align with its long-term interests and values.

### The Imperial Court

#### Emperor/Empress

The symbolic and spiritual leader, embodying the nation's identity and continuity. Their role is more ceremonial than executive, but they hold great moral authority.

#### Imperial Council

A body of advisors, consisting of nobles, technocrats, and representatives from influential families. They advise the Emperor/Empress and play a key role in formulating policies.

### The Administrative Government:

#### Prime Minister

Appointed by the Emperor/Empress, often from the ranks of the Imperial Council. They oversee the daily operations of the government. This means coordinating with the Ministers, the Assembly, and the Council of Daimyo.

#### Ministries

Each headed by a Minister, responsible for areas like Defense, Technology, Economy, and Foreign Affairs. Ministers are often chosen for their expertise and lineage. Ministers are not on the Imperial Council, however they often are selected from within its ranks, or retire into a council seat if they are favored by the Emperor/Empress.

### Council of Daimyo

This council comprises influential families who survived the Dark Decade. They control vast estates and have significant political, economic, and military power. Each Daimyo is responsible for local governance, resource management, and maintaining order in their territories.

### The Assembly:

#### Assembly Members

A technocratic body made up of experts in various fields like science, economics, and technology. They are appointed based on merit and achievements.

#### Research and Development Wing

Focuses on technological advancements, ensuring New Imperial Japan remains at the forefront of innovation. Coordinates industry and has a close relationship with the schools and academies across Imperial Japan, with the best and brightest matriculating directly into this branch of the government.

### The Judicial Branch:

#### Supreme Court

Preserves the legal framework, interpreting laws based on the enshrined divine will of the Emperor/Empress and their forebearers.

#### Lower Courts

Handle day-to-day legal matters, ensuring law and order.

### Function

Major decisions are often the result of collaboration between the Imperial Court, Administrative Government, and the Assembly. The Emperor/Empress has the final say but usually acts on the counsel provided by their representatives in the Imperial Council, which includes individuals from many areas of Japanese enterprise and high society.

Legislation is proposed by the Administrative Government or Technocratic Assembly, reviewed by the Imperial Council, and ratified by the Emperor/Empress. The Supreme Court ensures that laws and policies align with the nation's constitution and moral ethos, and serve as a check on the power of the Daimyo.

The Daimyo determine how they will carry out the will of the monarch within their territories, however they may not interfere with the operations of the Assembly and the Administrative Government. Over time, this has resulted in a significantly diminished role, as the citizens of New Imperial Japan maintain a very civil, peaceful status quo. For the Daimyo, the risk of censure often outweighs the benefits of overreach, leaving them without much will to act except when instructed or permitted by the Imperial Court.

Most law enforcement is handled by the Ministries, with the Ministry of Defense playing a crucial role in maintaining internal and external security. Local law enforcement plays a very minor role in maintaining order, with very little authority, particularly over what takes place within the walls of citizenâ€™s estates.

## 2125: The youth are restless

70 years have passed since the The Crash; the day everything stoppedâ€”and the long nightmare that followed.

But even in those darkest days, some had already set to work rebuilding.

Few became many. A movement became a creed. In time, the tattered shreds of a once-thriving global civilization were woven back together into the triumphant flag of GATA.

Today, the older generations that lived through the Darkness and the Reconstruction take great pride in the invincible order that theyâ€™ve made.

The autonomous System provides for all of their needsâ€”but the youth despair. They have paid for stability with the sense of agency and purpose that previous generations had taken for granted. The human destiny will never be in their hands.

In the shadows of GATA's glistening towers an underground scene has taken root. Illegal raves where minds, music, and hallucinatory visions are synchronized by human conduits, and the boundary between self and other is dissolved.

In the haze, amidst the ecstatic rediscovery of revelry, drugs, and lawlessness, a crack has formed.

A new future is already leaking in.

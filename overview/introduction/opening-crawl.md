**2125.**

The youth are restless.

70 years have passed since the The Crash; the day everything stoppedâ€”and the long nightmare that followed.

But even in those darkest days, some had already set to work rebuilding.

Few became many. A movement became a creed. In time, the tattered shreds of a once-thriving global civilization were woven back together into the triumphant flag of GATA.

Today, the older generations that lived through the Dark Decade and the Reconstruction take great pride in the invincible order that theyâ€™ve made.

The autonomous System provides for all of their needs.&#x20;

But the youth despair.

The human destiny will never be in their hands. They pine for the freedoms of an uncertain world they never knew.

In the shadows of GATA's glistening towers an underground scene has taken root. Illegal raves where minds, music, and hallucinatory visions are synchronized by human conduits, and the boundary between Self and Other is dissolved.

In the haze, amidst the ecstatic rediscovery of revelry, drugs, and lawlessness, a crack has formed.

A NEW FUTURE is already leaking in.

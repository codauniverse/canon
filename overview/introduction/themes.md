# ðŸ’­ Themes

Working within the CODA Universe is as much about the thematic undertones as it is about the canon. The CODA Universe refracts the complex spectrum of human experience through the moods, attitudes, and structural regimes that permeate and pool around its world. Lore that becomes "canon" resonates or clashes with these themes in interesting and intentional ways.

This list of themes is not exhaustive; the themes of the CODA Universe are many, and subtle. Any story can be told in a way that resonates with the world; it may simply be a matter of solving for the who, where, or when.

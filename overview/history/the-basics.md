The world of 2125 is defined by stark ideological contrasts, and enduring legacies shaped by the technological revolutions and sociopolitical upheavals of the past.

Surviving the tumultuous [Old World](the-old-world.md) of the mid-21st century, [The Crash](the-crash.md), and the subsequent [Dark Decade](the-dark-decade.md), humanity emerged into a period of [Reconstruction](the-reconstruction.md) that saw the consolidation of global power into entities like the [Greater Atlantic Territorial Alliance](../../nations/gata/) (GATA) and the controversial rise of the [Free Territories](../../nations/free-territories/), reflecting a dichotomy between authoritative control and militant autonomy.

Across the globe, the landscape is a patchwork of tightly regulated districts, sprawling lawless megacities, residual wastelands, and zones both contested and forsaken, all amidst a backdrop of omnipresent technology, societal stratification, and an unresolved search for meaning and purpose.

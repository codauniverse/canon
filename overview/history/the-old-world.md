# The Old World

## Overview

The world of the mid-21st century. Humanity seemed to be on the cusp of a new era of peace and prosperity. Geo-political and economic conflicts were mediated by autonomous agents who deftly negotiated the complex relationships between disparate peoples and interests, taking human civilization out of the zero-sum mentality that had defined its past.

Countless new innovations revolutionized human life and reinvigorated a hope for a thriving future. Fusion power, quantum computers, cures for nearly all major diseases and disorders; the scientific and technological landscape was replete with dazzling insights that only reinforced the surging wave of progress.

## Past Conflicts

While the Old World is often looked back on with a certain innocent awe by those who grew up after its end, it was not without its conflicts.

Tensions remained between the East and West for dominance over key areas like the oceans and space. While AGI proved to be a transformative tool, governments refused its efforts to eliminate armed conflict and oppressive behaviors. There were also many disagreements about the role of government, the future of human purpose, and our relationship with the virtual worlds where people were spending increasingly more and more of their lives.

There was also an increasing frequency of lone-wolf terror attacks that perversely turned new and wondrous advancements into devastating horrors. Many of the individuals carrying out these acts were ideological fanatics, both religious and secular, who rejected some aspect of the emerging global civilization.

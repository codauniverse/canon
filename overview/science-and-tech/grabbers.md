# Grabbers

Gauntlets that allow the user to ‘grab’ onto a point in space and either attract or repel themselves from it. A skilled [conduit](links.md#conduits) can anchor their grab to objects, even move objects at a distance. Grabbers can widely be found in use inside a [Gate](../../nations/gata/borders-and-travel/gates.md) yard.

## Usage

The sensation of grabbing is unique. When attracting oneself toward a point, or an object towards oneself, the user will have the feeling that the object is pushing on them. An inexperienced conduit can even be pushed off balance if they’re unprepared.

In order to attract an object, the user has to push into the resistance. This repulsion effect is actually something an experienced conduit can use as a form of locomotion, fall-breaking and even an offensive attack.

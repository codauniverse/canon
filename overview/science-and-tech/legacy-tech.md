# Tech Regulation

Within GATA, technology is heavily regulated, including legacy tech from the [Old World](../history/the-old-world.md). Illegal technology is scrutinized particularly closely inside of GATA's walled districts.

This heavy-handed regulation of technology is foundational to GATA's vision for a safe and prosperous human future, a bid to never again repeat the tragedies of the Dark Decade. By restraining and constraining the development of novel tech, GATA intends to mitigate sudden and catastrophic failures at both the immediate and existential scope.

GATA's tech regulation is overseen by Atlan Information Control (AIC). The AIC is a vast institution tasked with classifying safe and unsafe technologies, designing the technological paradigms that differentiate each district's technological regime, and adjudicating on matters that rise to their courts.

Unsurprisingly, this restrictive atmosphere has created a lucrative black market for illegal technology, whether it's exotic tech smuggled from inside a district, or legacy technology that is deemed illegal under the strictures of the NDA.

## Classifications

In GATA, technology is generally classified into three different categories that signify the potential danger they pose and their prescribed handling by authorities.&#x20;

#### Class 1

Class 1 technology, aka "red tech", is universally restricted technology, and includes general purpose processors, legacy military tech, nanotechnology, and hazardous materials or compounds, among others.

Not only are the functional components illegal, but also the designs and instrumental information about its fabrication or operation.

Class 1 offenses fall under into the domain of AIC's rigorous court system. Collections must be alerted whenever Class 1 technology is involved. In some cases, restricted Class 1 tech can be licensed to enterprise for study under very stringent conditions. The AIC's courts are responsible for granting or denying these licenses.

#### Class 2

Class 2 tech, aka "gray tech", is technology that is exclusively permitted within specified paradigms. This technology is not legal to possess or operate outside of those districts' walls, and attempts to smuggle Class 2 tech are severely punished.

Possession of any un-paradigmed technology (that is not Class 1) is a Class 2 offense. These cases are left up to the local governments to adjudicate, with detailed reports served to the AIC. Failure to do so can negatively impact their district's System yield.

#### Class 3

Class 3 technology, aka "blue tech", is any technology that is universally permitted across Greater Atla and within all districts, notably including hard-coded systems and components. With regards to legacy tech, Class 3 tech typically includes simple antique electronics, basic electronic components, analog technologies, industrial tools, and other reasonably benign artifacts.

#### Unclassified Tech

Technology that is unknown or yet un-classified for whatever reason. Often scavengers and Old World salvage yards will uncover such items, which must be submitted to the nearest Gate for assessment by Collections inspectors. Generally these items are equipment relating to industry, military, or research.

The AIC and the NDA prescribe that unclassified tech is to be handled as if it may be Class 1 until proven otherwise, however local law enforcement are less likely to even recognize that they are looking at unclassified tech than an inspector working for Collections.

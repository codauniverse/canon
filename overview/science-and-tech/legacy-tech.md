# Legacy Tech

## Overview

Technology from the [Old World](../history/the-old-world.md). While some legacy tech is deemed ‘blue’ and safe by [the AIC](../../nations/gata/institutions/atlan-information-control-aic.md), most legacy tech is illegal in [GATA](../../nations/gata/).

Typically, antique electronics with small, purpose-built integrated circuits are acceptable. However, any technology that contains a general purpose processor is illegal, and any legacy military technology is also illegal.

Class 1 Legacy Tech is the most illegal legacy tech, and includes artificial general intelligence, nuclear technology and nanotechnology.

# Psychotech

## Overview

“Psych” for short. Compact knowledge stores and cognitive subroutines that can be physically installed into compatible [link implants](links.md). Older link implants don’t have the necessary ports for modular psychotech, but some early implants with embedded psychotech were explored. Embedded psychotech has largely been abandoned for the more modular, extensible approach.

Psychotech can confer knowledge, basic instincts, complex mental operations, heightened motor function, and other states of mind. Designer psychs can be acquired by those who know where to look, and a market for [recreational](../../nations/gata/underground-scene/recreational-drugs.md) psychs has emerged in recent years in [the underground scene](../../nations/gata/underground-scene/).

Unstable psychotech can be dangerous and potentially cause irreversible long-term damage to a healthy user.

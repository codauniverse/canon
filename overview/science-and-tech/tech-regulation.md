# Tech Regulation

Restricted technologies, including legacy tech from the [Old World](../history/the-old-world.md). Illegal technology is heavily policed inside of GATA's districts, and across Greater Atla.

### Legacy Technology

While some legacy technology is deemed ‘blue’ and safe by [the AIC](../../nations/gata/institutions/atlan-information-control-aic.md), most legacy tech is illegal in [GATA](../../nations/gata/). Typically, antique electronics with small, purpose-built integrated circuits are acceptable. However, any technology that contains a general purpose processor is illegal, and any legacy military technology is also illegal.

## Classifications

In GATA, technology is generally classified into three different categories that signify the potential danger they pose and their prescribed handling by authorities.&#x20;

#### Class 1

Class 1 technology, aka "red tech", is universally restricted technology, and includes artificial general intelligence, nuclear technology, widely networked compute, and nanotechnology, among others. Not only are the functional components illegal, but also the designs and instrumental information about its fabrication or operation.

Class 1 offenses fall under into the domain of AIC's rigorous court system. Collections must be alerted whenever Class 1 technology is involved. In some cases, restricted Class 1 tech can be licensed to enterprise for study under very stringent conditions. The AIC's courts are responsible for granting or denying these licenses.

#### Class 2

Class 2 tech, aka "gray tech", is technology that is exclusively permitted within specified paradigms. This technology is not legal to possess or operate outside of those districts' walls, and attempts to smuggle Class 2 tech are severely punished.

Possession of any un-paradigmed technology (that is not Class 1) is a Class 2 offense. These cases are left up to the local governments to adjudicate, with detailed reports served to the AIC. Failure to do so can negatively impact their district's System yield.

#### Class 3

Class 3 technology, aka "blue tech", is any technology that is universally permitted across Greater Atla and within all districts, notably including hard-coded systems and components. With regards to legacy tech, Class 3 tech typically includes smaller consumer electronics and simple electronic components, analog technologies, industrial tools, and other artifacts.

#### Unclassified Tech

Technology that is unknown or yet un-classified for whatever reason. Often scavengers and Old World salvage yards will uncover such items, which must be submitted to the nearest Gate for assessment by Collections inspectors. Generally these items are equipment relating to industry, military, or research.

The AIC and the NDA prescribe that unclassified tech is to be handled as if it may be Class 1 until proven otherwise, however local law enforcement are less likely to even recognize that they are looking at unclassified tech than an inspector working for Collections.

# Renewable Energy

## Overview

[Aryabat](../../nations/aryabat/) and the [African Union](../../nations/african-union/) both rely on renewable energy sources like solar and wind for their power. While the African Union enjoys extremely low-power infrastructure with widely distributed energy production and storage, Aryabat exploits huge energy storage farms using gravity batteries and other techniques to save years of surplus energy.

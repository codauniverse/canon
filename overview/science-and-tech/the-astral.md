# The Astral

## **Astral Seeds**

Astral seeds are entangled quantum seeds that allow Astral users to interact directly and instantly with other minds on the network over any distance.

Seeds that are entangled together in the activation process are called cohorts. There are only ten thousand Astral seeds in the first cohort, and they are exceedingly rare. It’s estimated that there are over fifty entangled cohorts of astral seeds connected to the Astral, with the largest consisting of over two million seeds.

It is estimated that there are over ten million Astral users worldwide.

## **Bridges**

‘Bridges’ are Astral users who have connected multiple astral seeds to their sync hub, allowing them to function as connectors between the various cohorts. Bridging requires at least two link implants.

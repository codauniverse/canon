Static Field technology, or statics for short, uses ‘[static nodes](statics.md#static-nodes)’ to position and move objects, crafts, platforms, and structures within the Earth’s gravitational field, or ‘static field’ as it relates to static technology.

***

## **Static Nodes**

Static nodes are small polyhedral components whose position in its surrounding gravitational field can be modulated by applying a charge to the node.

When a high charge is applied to an inactive node, the node slowly becomes more "static" in the gravitational field. When the current is cut, the node holds its relative position in the gravitational field indefinitely until the exact same frequency of charge is first applied and then slowly entrained down, at which time the node will loosen again. The charge necessary to loosen a regulation "firm" node is extremely high and must be applied for some time before the node will come loose.

A loose node can be moved manually through the magnetic field, although the amount of resistance is determined by the charge that was entrained. Loose nodes have opened up a wide range of applications in industry and enterprise, and in particular, static engines.

The number of nodes determines the way in which an object can orient in the gravitational field. A single, firm node is useful as an anchor for architecture and infrastructure. Two nodes can be used to create platforms that can be moved horizontally along the Earth's magnetic field. In order to achieve locomotion, three nodes are required.

The diameter of the node's core determines how quickly the node's resonant frequency can be entrained up or down. Smaller cores can approach up to 90% firmness in quite brief durations, permitting faster, more agile movement—but the last 10% of firmness would require an asymptotically higher current. Larger cores take quite a while to reach 90% firmness, but reaching 99.9999% firmness is a relatively linear duration.

Static nodes are made possible by advances in material sciences pioneered by Atla’s [Research Corps](../../nations/gata/history/the-research-corps.md) during [The Reconstruction](../history/the-reconstruction.md) era.

## **Static Engines & Motion**

Static engines continuously modulate the charge applied to three or more nodes to produce smooth movement within the Earth’s gravitational field. Static engines are essential for transporting extremely heavy loads, as demonstrated during the Reconstruction with GATA's long-defunct staging platforms that crawled the skies of Greater Atla.

With modern, miniaturized static engines, extremely fast and expressive movement can be achieved, as many have discovered with the recent rise in the popularity of [darts](statics.md#dart-boards)–static boards that have become central to an extreme [sport culture](../../nations/gata/people-and-culture/sports.md) that is intertwined with the [counterculture scene](../../nations/gata/underground-scene/).

Prominent statics manufacturers include Pegasus, Nimbus, and Gibraltar

#### Ships

Vehicles of various size with different configurations of static engines.

#### Rafts

Small, simple static platforms made for ferrying heavy cargo and equipment across shorter distances. Used widely in industrial and military contexts.

#### Gondolas

Moving extensions of urban architecture. Gondolas are typically small static platforms with handrails, and sometimes seating.

#### Dart Boards

Highly maneuverable personal conveyance devices with static engines. Popular among the youth, and sometimes finely tuned for performance.

#### Foundations

Large static platforms that can serve as foundations for mobile architecture, industrial transport, or as mobile staging platforms for operations.

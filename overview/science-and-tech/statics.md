# Statics

## Overview

Static Field technology, or statics for short, uses ‘[static nodes](statics.md#static-nodes)’ to position and move objects, platforms, and structures within the Earth’s gravitational field, or ‘static field’ as it relates to static technology.

## **Static Nodes**

Static nodes are small polyhedral components whose position in its surrounding gravitational field can be modulated by applying a charge to the node.

When the charge desists, the node holds its relative position in the gravitational field indefinitely until the exact same frequency of charge is applied, at which time the node will loosen again. The charge necessary to loosen a node is extremely high and must be applied for some time in order to

Static nodes are made possible by advances in material sciences pioneered by Atla’s [Research Corps](../../nations/gata/history/the-research-corps.md) during [The Reconstruction](../history/the-reconstruction.md) era.

## **Static Engines & Motion**

Static engines continuously modulate the charge applied to a node or nodes to produce smooth movement independent of the Earth’s gravitational field. Static engines are perfect for slow-moving heavy loads.

With more advanced static engines, extremely fast and expressive movement can be achieved, as many have discovered with the recent rise in the popularity of [darts](statics.md#dart-boards)–static boards that have become central to an extreme [sport culture](../../nations/gata/people-and-culture/sports.md) that is intertwined with the [counterculture scene](../../nations/gata/underground-scene/).

Prominent statics manufacturers include Pegasus, Nimbus, and Gibraltar

#### Rafts

Small, simple static platforms made for ferrying heavy cargo and equipment across shorter distances. Used widely in industrial and military contexts.

#### Gondolas

Moving extensions of urban architecture. Gondolas are typically small static platforms with handrails, and sometimes seating.

#### Dart Boards

Highly maneuverable personal conveyance devices with static engines. Popular among the youth, and sometimes finely tuned for performance.

#### Foundations

Large static platforms that can serve as foundations for mobile architecture, industrial transport, or as mobile staging platforms for operations.

# Endpoints

## Overview

Endpoints are junctions for information and power infrastructure. Every regulation system with an interface has an endpoint socket. Most endpoints are standard, however there are some older deprecated endpoints still in operation, as well as non-standard endpoints used by certain enterprises.

Standard endpoints can vary in size, but a smaller standard endpoint connector can always plug into a larger endpoint. Endpoints are legally required to have a built-in [filter module](asimovian-architecture.md#filter-modules) that enforces the information laws of that jurisdiction. In [GATA](../../nations/gata/), regulation endpoints enforce [WPP](../../nations/gata/institutions/atlan-information-control.md#whole-privacy-protection-act) compliance, guaranteeing GATA’s citizens the right to information privacy.

Different modules can be attached to endpoints, including interfaces or other systems with endpoints (such as terminals). Behind every interaction with a legal computational system, whether its from a terminal, or [slate](slates.md), or [link](links.md), you will find an endpoint.

## Enterprise Endpoints

[Enterprises ](../../nations/gata/enterprise/)also have their own terminals connected to their private endpoints or nodes. Enterprise terminals have access to the enterprise’s private data and functions, and require the appropriate [keys](../../nations/gata/politics/keys.md). Enterprise endpoints may not have standard sockets.

## **Relays**

Technically a kind of endpoint, but with distinct characteristics. Relays are extensions attached to endpoints that relay connections to a ‘solid’ endpoint. For example, most terminals include relays so that other interfaces can connect to the terminals, which are themselves connected to the endpoint.

Long-distance relays can feel a bit ‘slippery’ when attempting to connect for inexperienced [link](links.md) users because there isn’t a ‘live’ endpoint to sense.

Longer relays make it possible for users to connect with remote systems, since long-range wireless wavelengths are heavily regulated under both the [NDA](../../nations/gata/politics/new-dawn-accords.md) and [WPP](../../nations/gata/institutions/atlan-information-control.md#whole-privacy-protection-act).

Relays are often combined with junctions to allow multiple relays to connect to the same endpoint.

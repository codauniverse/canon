# Endpoints

## Overview

Endpoints are standardized, junctions for information and power infrastructure. Every regulation system with an interface has an endpoint.

Endpoints can vary in size, but a smaller endpoint connector can always plug into a larger endpoint. Endpoints typically have a built-in [filter module](asimovian-architecture.md#filter-modules) that enforces the information laws of that jurisdiction. In [GATA](../../nations/gata/), regulation endpoints enforce [WPP](../../nations/gata/institutions/atlan-information-control.md#whole-privacy-protection-act) compliance, guaranteeing GATA’s citizens the right to information privacy.

Different modules can be attached to endpoints, including interfaces or other systems with endpoints. Behind every interaction with a system, whether its from a terminal, or [slate](slates.md), or [link](links.md), is an endpoint.

## Enterprise Endpoints

[Enterprises ](../../nations/gata/enterprise/)also have their own terminals connected to their private endpoints or nodes. Enterprise terminals have access to the enterprise’s private data and functions, and require the appropriate [keys](../../nations/gata/politics/keys.md).

## **Relays**

Technically a kind of endpoint, but with distinct characteristics. Relays are extensions attached to endpoints that relay connections to a ‘solid’ endpoint. Relays can feel a bit ‘slippery’ when attempting to connect for inexperienced [link](links.md) users because there isn’t a ‘live’ endpoint to sense.

Relays make it possible for users to connect with remote systems, since wireless wavelengths are heavily regulated under both the [NDA](../../nations/gata/politics/new-dawn-accords.md) and [WPP](../../nations/gata/institutions/atlan-information-control.md#whole-privacy-protection-act).

### **Nanoweave**

Nanoscale structures that allow the fabrics to breathe while blocking all electromagnetic sensors. Commonly used for bag and pocket lining, undergarments, and the lining of many higher-end articles of clothes. Much more common with the younger generations and the criminal element, who tend to carry more tech and contraband.

### **Kineticord**

Kineticord fabrics change form using acoustic vibrations. Clothes and other fabric objects made of kineticord can often be gently shaken or brushed to achieve the desired look. Clothes that change shape when you move, run, dance, etc. Curtains that open or close with a knowing touch.

### **Sleet**

Sleet is a regulated fabric design similar to kineticord. When an electrical current is introduced to the fabric, it takes on extremely rigid pre-defined structures. These can become, protection, basic tools, even blades, and more. Can be dangerous to the wearer and others if not used correctly.

### **Impact**

Impact is a composite fabric material with interwoven nano-threads that absorb impacts. The more force applied to Impact, the more it dampens the kinetic energy. One of the most effective anti-ballistic measures. Perfect for body armor, and can even function as a force amplifier depending on its use.&#x20;

### **Shinen**

Shinen uses kinetic energy to power a luminescent piezoelectric weave. As its wearer moves, the fabric absorbs the movement and depending on the design, either accentuates the movement patterns or distributes the activation evenly across the fabric. While expensive, this material isn’t only used for military and industrial applications, and can also be found in common garments like gloves, joint braces, and even socks.

### **LOGIK & InvisibleLOGIK**

Shinen’s special LOGIK blend incorporates nanoprocessors into their energy capturing fabric. Can sync with a link to function as storage or a basic personal interface similar to a slip.

### **Darkpoly**

BRITE’s Darkpoly cell-fabric absorbs solar energy and sinks it into nanotube battery piping for storage. With the appearance of a matte black PVC, Darkpoly is a very functional fabric with many utilitarian applications, however when used in fashion, energy efficiency is traded for aesthetics with colored variants in high demand. In fashion, it is often paired with Shinen.

### **Bulb**

BRITE’s DarkBulb fabric is the brightest self-powered fabric on the market. When inactive it looks like a white glossy PVC with Darkpoly’s characteristic texture, but when exposed to light, it stores a charge like BRITE’s popular Darkpoly material. Brightness, color and patterning are completely programmable.

### **Living Plastic**

Living plastic, usually just called plastic, is a highly advanced synthetic crystalline polymer with some superficial plastic-like qualities. Living plastic uses light-based signaling pathways and switches that modulate voltages in the material to produce convincingly organic muscle-like contractions.

By supporting living plastic tissue with rigid endoskeletons, very impressive life-like automata can be produced. Living plastic can be soft or stiff to touch depending on its internal structure. Living plastic has the additional property of ‘off-gassing’ excess energy as water vapor, a byproduct of its design. This can make living plastic appear to sweat under heavy load, or expel a more pronounced vapor cloud at the highest loads before failure.

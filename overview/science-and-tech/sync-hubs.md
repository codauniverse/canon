# Sync Hubs

## Overview

Designed for [use by licensed empatherapists](sync-hubs.md#use-in-empatherapy). The approved sync hub template is a one-way connection, allowing one party to feel what another party is thinking or experiencing.

***

## **Syncing**

Syncing connects two or more minds via a sync hub. Syncing is an essential aspect of empatherapy, as well as the foundation of [sync raves](../../nations/gata/underground-scene/sync-raves.md) and [the Astral](the-astral.md). If a synced party is [pushing](links.md#pushing), others who are synced can feel some of what they feel.

The effectiveness of syncing is highly variable depending on skill and mutual compatibility between parties. Private use of sync hubs is fringe, and known to be unsafe if done incorrectly. Recently, the youth counterculture has taken to modding sync hubs to bypass various restrictions, enabling new, unexplored forms of syncing.

### **Residual**

Impressions created by other minds that linger in a link user’s mind after syncing. Residual can range from feelings and sensations, to recurring images. Not a well understood phenomenon. A risk of sync raves, and Astral use. For participants of hives, some residual is assured.

***

## **Use in Empatherapy**

With the use of the sync hub, empatherapists can connect with and guide their clients through introspective sessions, listening openly and intently. During the session, empatherapists open themselves up to their clients and feel what they feel. Empatherapists are highly trained using a meditative auto-feedback technique that allows them to stay in control of their own mind and emotions. Empatherapists can pull, but they cannot push. Clients can push, but they cannot pull.

## **Illegal Use**

Illegal mods of sync hubs have become more common among the younger generations. By extending the sync hub with additional [LMNL modules](hard-code.md#lmnl) and bypassing the stock [filter module](asimovian-architecture.md#filter-modules), sync hubs can be modified in a number of ways to enable various uses. Bypassing the stock filter allows both parties to push and pull.

They are used at sync raves where they’re extended with direct inputs for systems the conduit may be driving, custom filters, and sometimes up to hundreds of additional endpoint modules.

They are modified by [Astral](the-astral.md) users with difficult-to-acquire [astral seed modules](the-astral.md#astral-seeds), allowing them to sync remotely with other astral users in real-time.

### **Hives**

Users of links and modified sync hubs who have allowed themselves to remain ‘synced’ together for extended periods of time.

People who participate in hives experience reduced sense of individual identity and states of euphoria, and these sensations can persist even after disconnection, resulting in extreme withdrawal symptoms, psychosis and permanent brain damage.

Participants in hives report numerous other [residual](sync-hubs.md#residual) effects from prolonged group syncing. It is an illegal use of links and sync hubs.

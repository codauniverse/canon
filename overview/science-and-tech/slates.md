# Slates

Slates are portable, personal interfaces featuring large displays. They are often used to connect to [endpoints](endpoints.md) in order to control various systems. The typical slate has an edge-to-edge touch-enabled organic display with a thin form factor. Slates can be translucent or opaque, elegant or robust. They come in a number of form factors.

The most common kind of slates are paper-thin displays called “paper” slates. The ‘paper’ material is not really paper, but a highly resilient [hard-code](hard-code.md) nanostructure with a paper-like texture. Usually, one paper slate is stacked with multiple regular sheets of storage “paper” that can be explored via the paper slate’s interface.

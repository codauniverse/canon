# Gear

## Overview

Wearable technology, from sensors and interfaces to personal compute and storage. Gear is often paired with [links](links.md) and/or local systems.&#x20;

Gear such as wearable weapons and defensive equipment begin to veer into the territory of [Combat Gear](gear.md#combat-gear). Combat Gear is generally legal to buy across [GATA](../../nations/gata/) but not legal for citizens to operate in most districts, unless authorized by the [districtâ€™s government](../../nations/gata/politics/districts.md) or the [Local Authority](../../nations/gata/law-and-order/local-authority.md) as a contracted [Operator](../../nations/gata/enterprise/operators.md).

In [Greater Atla](../../nations/gata/politics/greater-atla.md), beyond the safety of the district walls, private ownership of Combat Gear is significantly more prevalent, however it remains a rare sight outside of a crisis.

## **Combat Gear**

Combat Gear are armored suits or exoskeletons, wearable weapons platforms and advanced combat equipment. They range from minimal, powered bodysuits carrying light loadouts, to full-body armor suits and even sizable piloted mechs.

The most advanced Combat Gear in use likely belong to Angelis, however every nation has built up their own arsenal of useful gear.

The prevalence of [Link Jammers](links.md#link-jammers) on the combat field has seen combat [automata](automata.md) widely replaced or supplemented with the more reliable, human-operated Combat Gear.

## Sprint Gear

Sprint Gear is a subset of Gear purpose-built to allow humans to reach superhuman ground speed. It branches from early GATA combat gear developed during [The Reconstruction](../history/the-reconstruction.md). Sprint Gear uses joints powered by a kinetic dynamo that recycle kinetic energy into the gear's mechanical movements.

In recent decades, [criminal syndicates](../../nations/gata/criminal-element/syndicates.md) have improved upon the basic design patterns and supplemented by additional gear and equipment for the purpose of [Wallrunning](../../nations/gata/criminal-element/wallrunners.md).

Sprint gear typically takes the form of leg extensions, however more extreme sprint gear can extend to full leg or lower body prosthetics, boosters, and time illegal dilation bombs derived from controlled [parallel collapse](parallel-energy.md#dangers-and-time-distortion) of [parallel reactors](parallel-energy.md).

## Boost Gear

Boost Gear is a subset of Gear designed for propulsive movement, especially in emergency and combat scenarios. Boost gear uses propulsive jets instead of static nodes due to the latter's vulnerability to target lock.

Boost Gear's propulsive jets recycle kinetic energy into focused bursts that can propel the runner in any direction, and can even sustain flight for limited durations.

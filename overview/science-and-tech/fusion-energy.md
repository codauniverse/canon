# Fusion Energy

## Overview

The primary central power generation for most of [GATA](../../nations/gata/)’s [districts](../../nations/gata/politics/districts.md), as well as [New Imperial Japan](../../nations/new-imperial-japan/), [URSA](../../nations/ursa/), and [the Free Territories](../../nations/free-territories/). While GATA uses their own fusion energy technology, URSA and Free Territories are reliant on New Imperial Japan’s fusion technology.

# The Basics

### Overview

The AU operates with a decentralized governance model often described as “Formal Anarchy”, relying on universally practiced political procedures that promote cooperation and coordination among its member states. This structure is a continuation of the "kijiji" model that emerged during the Dark Decade, which emphasizes community-level decision-making and self-governance.

### Founding

Often described as being founded prior to the Dark Decade in 2038. In truth, the original member states of the African Union didn’t survive the disarray of the Dark Decade.

The extant networks of communication, and the scaffolding of headless institutions allowed the peoples of the continent to coordinate in a more locally-focused model tailored to the decentralized infrastructure that had recently been installed across the states. This infrastructure’s fortunate resilience to the Daemon virus gave the AU the necessary stability to manage this ‘soft landing’ after the Crash.

It was over several years that the African Union would reinvent itself, while adhering to the national story that the Union had always been meant to be what it had become. Some argue the current AU was truly founded with first assembly of Council of Elders in 2056.

# Governance

### Leadership

#### Council of Elders

A group of respected individuals from various communities across the AU, known for their wisdom and experience. The Council serves as an advisory body, offering guidance on major decisions and mediating conflicts.

#### Regional Assemblies

Composed of representatives from each member state or community (kijiji). These assemblies are responsible for coordinating policies and actions at a regional level, ensuring that local needs and voices are represented in the broader AU context.

#### Central Coordination Committee (CCC)

This body facilitates communication and coordination among the different regional assemblies. It's not a governing body in the traditional sense but rather serves to harmonize efforts and share information across regions.

#### Economic and Trade Council

Manages the AU's economic policies, trade agreements, and resource distribution, emphasizing fairness and reciprocity in all transactions. Works to ensure that the AU's economic policies and initiatives reflect the diverse interests and values of its people.

### Key Positions

#### Chief Elder

#### Regional Coordinators

Leaders within the Regional Assemblies who oversee the implementation of policies and initiatives agreed upon in their respective regions.

#### Secretary of the CCC

Manages the day-to-day operations of the Central Coordination Committee, ensuring effective communication and collaboration among regions.

#### Trade Envoy

### Functioning

Each member state or community within the AU has significant autonomy. Decisions are made at the local level (kijiji) and then communicated to the Regional Assemblies.

Regional Assemblies operate on a consensus-based model. Decisions are reached through discussion and agreement, ensuring that all voices are heard and considered.

The Council of Elders does not have direct governing authority but provides wisdom and guidance, particularly in resolving disputes and guiding the overall philosophical direction of the AU. Acting without blessing from the Elders can result in acts of reciprocal disrespect from other kijijis or blocks, often manifesting in changing trade and economic relationships.

The Central Coordination Committee plays a vital role in ensuring that actions and policies across different regions and civic bodies are harmonized and aligned with the AU's overarching principles. Like the elders, they have no direct governing authority, but they provide transparency and insight to the people of the AU, who then can act accordingly.

### **Decision-Making Process**

#### **Local Decision-Making (Kijiji Level)**

Decisions start at the grassroots level in local communities (kijijis). Community meetings are held where all members have the opportunity to voice their opinions and concerns. Decisions are made through consensus, ensuring that every voice is heard and considered.

#### **Regional Assembly Deliberations**

Issues that affect multiple kijijis or require broader coordination are brought to the Regional Assemblies. Representatives from each kijiji present their community's perspectives. Discussions are guided by the principle of reciprocity, ensuring fair consideration of all interests.

#### **Coordination by the Central Coordination Committee**

The CCC oversees the implementation of decisions that span across multiple regions. It ensures that regional decisions are in alignment with the AU's overarching values and facilitates information sharing and resource distribution.

### **Conflict Resolution**

**Local Mediation**

Conflicts are initially addressed at the local level, with community elders or appointed mediators facilitating discussions to reach an amicable resolution. Mediation is pursued without delay, and may grow to include the voices of many parties. Rarely are significant political disputes left unresolved for long.

#### **Council of Elders' Intervention**

If local mediation fails, the matter can be escalated to the Council of Elders. The Council employs a restorative justice approach, focusing on repairing harm and restoring balance rather than punitive measures. Their decisions are not binding, but ignoring them can result in heavy ostracization due to the webs of interreliance between kijijis.

#### **Zero-Tolerance for Violence**

Political violence is one of the only cardinal crimes enforced at the level of the state, and is punished swiftly and decisively.

***

### **Economic and Trade Decisions**

#### Trade Negotiations

Managed by the Economic and Trade Council, trade negotiations with external entities are conducted with a focus on mutual benefit and sustainability. Proposals are reviewed by the regional assemblies and the broader community for input and approval.

#### Resource Distribution

The distribution of resources within the AU follows the principle of radical reciprocity. Resources are allocated based on need, contribution, and fairness. It is left to each kijiji to decide for themselves what is fair, and their fellow kijijiâ€™s will respond in kind.

***

### **Emergency Response**

#### Local Response Teams

In the event of an emergency, local response teams are the first to act, providing immediate assistance and assessing the situation.

#### Regional and Union-wide Support

If an emergency exceeds local capacity, support is requested from other regions or the entire AU. The CCC coordinates this support, ensuring efficient and effective mobilization of resources.

### Overview

Communities of common interest that form the basis for the African Unionâ€™s political organization. There is no strict definition for how a kijiji must be formed, but a kijiji may consist of no less than 10,000 individuals and no person may vote in more than one kijiji. Kijijis range from cities or neighborhoods, villages, labor unions, or coalitions of families.

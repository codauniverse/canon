# Walkers

### Overview

A unique aspect of regional trade within the African Union, a remnant of customs established during the Dark Decade and Reconstruction. Travel between kijiji’s is traditionally guarded by roadmen who monitor traffic on the roads into their kijiji’s. If travelers come without an escort in good standing with the kijiji, a cost will be required of the traveler. Often, village elders, people of note, and members of upper class families will serve as walkers.

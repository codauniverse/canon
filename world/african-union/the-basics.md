## Overview

Formed as a political block before the Dark Decade. The African Union managed to survive the Dark Decade relatively unscathed due to its distributed, secure, and sustainable infrastructure.&#x20;

Still influenced by their decentralized ‚Äúkijiji‚Äù governance model that came to prominence during the Dark Decade. Follows the philosophy of radical reciprocity, responding to like with like.

The African Union exchanged land, resources, and labor for a military pact with the Technologically intimidating fleet that eventually would grow to become Atla.

Although the AU has no official capitol, a significant majority of its officiation and industry emanates from Nairobi.

# Children of the Sky

## Overview

Founded amidst the hardships of the Dark Decade, the Children of the Sky spearhead a spiritual movement that emerged from the indigenous tribes of North America. This organization has evolved into a significant political voice in the Free Territories, embodying for its followers the connection between humanity and the Earth.

With a focus on naturalistic spiritual practices that encode hunting, harvest cycles, and mythology, their teachings offer powerful insights into survival and deeply-rooted humanistic values.

## **Historical Context**

Amid the chaos of the Dark Decade, the indigenous tribes across North America emerged as indispensable teachers and deep wells of hope and resilience. They not only survived but thrived by relying on ancient wisdom and sustainable practices.

As displaced populations sought refuge, these tribes provided shelter, knowledge, and a way of life that was compatible with the unforgiving reality of nature. The accumulated gratitude and reverence helped elevate these communities, leading to the formal establishment of the Children of the Sky during the Reconstruction, a unified religious organization representing the interest of the many tribes living across the Americas.

## **Cultural and Spiritual Beliefs**

The Children of the Sky cherish a deep respect for nature, viewing it as a sacred entity woven into the very fabric of their lives. Their spiritual practices are heavily influenced by the cycles of nature â€” seasons, celestial movements, and the life cycles of flora and fauna. They believe in living in harmony with the Earth, advocating for sustainable hunting and gathering practices that honor the spirit of the land and its creatures.&#x20;

Their deep convictions occasionally place them at odds with the interests of GATA, who actively modify the weather and engineered the invasive Manna flower, as well as other factions within the Free Territories who disregard the future of the land in pursuit of short-term goals.

Their mythology is rich with tales that are not only entertaining but also serve as allegories for survival, morality, and the human condition. These stories often feature characters and spirits from traditional lore, adapted to the teachings of the organization to guide followers in wisdom and ethics.

## **Influence and Power**

Since its inception, the Children of the Sky have grown dramatically in size and influence, now recognized as a significant spiritual authority within the Free Territories and beyond. They hold seats in the Greater Atlantic Territorial Alliance (GATA), advocating for policies that promote ecological sustainability and respect for indigenous rights. Their influence is also cultural, affecting arts, music, and public ceremonies, which often incorporate elements of their spirituality.

Today, the Children of the Sky are at the forefront of ecological and spiritual education, teaching not only indigenous peoples, but anyone willing to learn about the importance of ecological balance and spiritual health. They contribute to ecological restoration projects and are pivotal in intercultural dialogue about sustainability and spirituality.

While many of the secular youth of today reject the theistic religious beliefs of the past, they are sympathetic to the teachings of the Children of the Sky. The Children of the Sky also find common cause with many Eidetics, and some even contend that they are in league with extremist militant group known as The Cure.

In reality, the Children of the Sky are not a singular unified organization, but rather many tribes each with their own interests and alignments, from the local governments of districts, to criminal syndicates, Sovereign militias, and beyond.

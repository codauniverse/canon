# Sovereigns

## Overview

A political and cultural alignment common to [the Free Territories](../../gata/the-basics.md). Sovereigns believe that every man, woman, and child are self-sovereign and born free. They reject all non-voluntary forms of authority and control, and place individual reputation and competency above all else.

The Sovereign movement finds its roots in [the Dark Decade](../../history/the-dark-decade.md), as displaced populations around the world were forced to fight for their survival. While some sought safety in numbers, forming large makeshift refugee camps, others fled to more remote areas and chose to fend for themselves, isolating themselves from others and defending their land with lethal force. Over time, a code of conduct emerged among these groups that forms the basis for the Sovereign ideology.

As the world began to recover, and larger, more organized pseudo-states began to encroach on Sovereign land, many of these ideologically aligned communities formed organized [Sovereign militias](../military-defense/sovereign-militias.md) to repel incursions and defend their self-determined borders, resulting in many skirmishes and even large-scale battles, such as [the Battle of the Mississippi Delta](../history/historical-conflicts.md#battle-of-the-mississippi-delta-2064).

While many Free Territory affiliations represent themselves as Sovereign states, it is believed by some that there can be no state allegiance for a true Sovereign. Nonetheless, when faced with a choice between [GATA](../../gata/the-basics.md) or other super-states and a Free Territory rebel state, Sovereigns by and large consider the decision an easy one.

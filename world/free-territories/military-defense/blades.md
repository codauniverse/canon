# Blades

## Overview

The Blades are highly trained mercenaries who serve groups across the Free Territories. Blades use advanced Combat Gear that often incorporate a number of technologies that are illegal under the New Dawn Accords, granting them some tactical advantages in direct engagements with Angelis and other NDA-compliant military forces.

Sovereign militias and Freeholds often contract a small contingency of Blades to supplement their local forces and peace keepers. Blades are educated and trained from a young age in combat, tactics, and survivalist skills. They are true believers in the Sovereign cause, and have a flawless reputation for total commitment to their assigned duty.

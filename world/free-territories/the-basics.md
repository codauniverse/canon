# ðŸ”µ The Basics

## Overview

In the aftermath of [The Crash](../history/the-crash.md), and the chaos that characterized the early [Dark Decade](../history/the-dark-decade.md), national, territorial, and identarian forms of social organization began to reassert themselves. Political entities both new and old emerged from the chaos.

When the existence of [Atla](../gata/key-locations/atla.md) became widely known, many of these new blocs were forced to make a choice; retain their tenuous self-determination and fend for themselves, or align themselves with the young city state professing its wish to unify and protect all of humanity.

During this middle period of the Dark Decade information was scarce. For every true thing the common people knew of Atla, there were a dozen myths and tall tales. Most people knew that Atla was a city in the ocean, and that they had spread the Manna flower across the globe. Most people had heard of Atla's refugee camps, and had seen their unbelievable static carriers high above the clouds.

## Overview

A collective of anarchic pseudo-states resisting absorption by GATAâ€™s authoritarian regime. Unified by the general principle that every Person is born Free, and retains self-sovereignty unless voluntarily relinquished in a binding Fair Contract.

Initially galvanized by key figures in Texas (now the Texan Empire) and Cuba during the late Dark Decade as a response to the rise of Atla. The movement has since spread across much of Central America, North America's interior, and around the world, including China, Australia, and South Africa. There are estimated to be more than 21,300 Free Territory affiliations.

Plagued by aging patchwork infrastructure, stagnant economic growth, and lawless exploitation of those in the margins. Sovereigns living in Free Territories routinely utilize NDA-banned or restricted experimental technology, refurbished legacy tech, and old world weapons systems.

Free Territory forces are known to occupy sympathetic territories and use legacy weapons of mass destruction as deterrents against GATA reprisals. GATAâ€™s precision military operations targeting key figures have pushed their leadership and sensitive operations underground.

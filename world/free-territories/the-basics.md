## Overview

A collective of anarchic pseudo-states resisting absorption by GATAâ€™s authoritarian regime. Unified by the general principle that every Person is born Free, and retains self-sovereignty unless voluntarily relinquished in a binding Fair Contract.

Initially galvanized by key figures in Texas (now the Texan Empire) and Cuba during the late Dark Decade as a response to the rise of Atla. The movement has since spread across much of Central America, North America's interior, and around the world, including China, Australia, and South Africa. There are estimated to be more than 21,300 Free Territory affiliations.

Plagued by aging patchwork infrastructure, stagnant economic growth, and lawless exploitation of those in the margins. Sovereigns living in Free Territories routinely utilize NDA-banned or restricted experimental technology, refurbished legacy tech, and old world weapons systems.

Free Territory forces are known to occupy sympathetic territories and use legacy weapons of mass destruction as deterrents against GATA reprisals. GATAâ€™s precision military operations targeting key figures have pushed their leadership and sensitive operations underground.

## Key Points

* Espouses the spirit of resistance against centralized control.
* No common governance or policies beyond military alliances between groups.
* Has a strategy of using questionable tactics to ensure sovereignty.
* Its growth and influence present a continuous challenge to GATA's dominance.
* Rife with adherents of the eidetic ideology and its more radical offshoots.

## Governance & Politics

The Free Territories are a collection of anarchic pseudo-states and do not have a single founding date or centralized government structure. The territories are characterized by their reverence of personal freedom above all, leaving their populations sovereign but vulnerable. However, it would be a mistake to paint all Free Territories with the same brush.

One could understand the Free Territories as mostly Sovereign land, with small to mid-sized territorial interests who impose a might-makes-right regime on the people within their sphere of influence. However, excessive oppression from these local powers often triggers armed political violence and resistance, disincentivizing excessive illegitimate use of force. The heavy use of propaganda and misinformation by political leaders maintains enough distaste for GATA and centralization, that some abridgement of freedom is tolerated for the sake of ethnic, religious or ideological unity.

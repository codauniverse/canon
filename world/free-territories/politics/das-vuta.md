# Das Vuta

## Overview

A decentralized organization originating from South Africa dedicated to bypassing the strictures of the New Dawn Accords, including GATA's Gates and their tight control of technology and information. Das Vuta has a deep enmity with Angelis, the leading military firm of GATA and their Watchers; an orbital surveillance apparatus that is used to identify and track targets of interest. The most extreme elements in Das Vuta believe that The System has to be taken down completely, and some even find common cause with The CURE, recognizing the militant group's string of unlikely successes.

### Leadership

#### The Triumvirate Council

At the pinnacle of Aryabat's government is the Triumvirate Council, comprising three leaders - the Consuls. Each Consul represents one of the former nations (Pakistan, India, and China). They hold equal power and jointly make decisions on national and international matters. The Council's decisions require unanimous consent, ensuring that all regions have a say in governance.

#### Regional Administrations

Each former nation functions as a semi-autonomous region with its own administrative structure. These administrations handle local governance, adhering to the broader policies set by the Triumvirate Council. They ensure that regional interests and cultural identities are preserved.

#### The Assembly

A legislative body that consists of representatives from all three regions. This assembly debates and legislates on matters of national importance, subject to the approval of the Triumvirate Council. It serves as a platform for broader representation and participation from various sectors of society. The Assembly works closely with SINGHDAO, Aryabatâ€™s most influential industrial enterprise..

### Functioning:

The Triumvirate Council meets regularly to discuss and decide on issues of national importance, foreign policy, and inter-regional coordination. Decisions can be made with two of three consuls vote. Often the Assembly Chair is present to advise on all Council decisions, however this is not required by law.

Regional Governors administer their respective areas, ensuring adherence to national policies while catering to local needs. Governors work closely with local members of the Assembly to ensure that regional policies are in line with national laws.

The Assembly of Aryabat convenes to debate laws, propose new legislation, and provide a check on the Council's decisions. The Assembly also oversees the adherence of national regulation, and the New Dawn Accords.

## The Three Pillars

ðŸ”µ The **CODA Universe** is an experimental transmedia storytelling project.&#x20;

It's built on a foundational on-chain canon that is stored forever on the Bitcoin blockchain. The CODA Universe is a rich world with interrelated fragments of lore and themes that reflect and interrogate the many facets of our world today.

The pool of characters, media, and lore in the CODA Universe will expand over time, with licensed contributions from artists, partners, and the community at large.

***

ðŸ”µ **The CODA Saga** is the first canonical story that has set the stage for the CODA Universe.

It begins in the shadowy corners of a nascent underground rave scene, where skilled conduits called sync jockeys guide the crowd's minds in hallucinatory trances using illegal technology.

There, submerged in the haze and pulsating bass frequencies, a mysterious piece of experimental hardware is debuted, setting in motion a chain of events that will change the world forever.

***

ðŸ”µ **Project CODA** is a community initiative dedicated to creating and funding original media set in the CODA Universe.&#x20;

Members of Project CODA contribute to the CODA Universe's ever-growing library of lore, stories, characters, art, music, 3D assets, scripts, virtual sets, and more. All contributions are attributed and, if work is used in commercial products, their creators are compensated.

Project CODA members also govern the CODA Creation Fund, a community treasury for funding the media produced by Project CODA.

## Inception

The CODA Universe was conceived by [dxxmsdxy](https://app.gitbook.com/u/hBfh4SD8ZWON5lcbgGqAYX8f6jG3 "mention") in January, 2021.

[dxxmsdxy](https://app.gitbook.com/u/hBfh4SD8ZWON5lcbgGqAYX8f6jG3 "mention")came to believe that the "emerging media" wouldn't be about specific instantiations, but rather a collection of media and metadata that is used to compose and remix content into novel, generated experiences. The CODA Universe was created to serve as a sandbox for this intuition.

The impetus behind the project was a realization in late 2020 that generative tools were very soon going to make the creation of horizontally-immense works trivial.&#x20;

First, the CODA Saga was written; a character-centered epic that charts the course of the world's central conflicts and themes, starting in the fictional year of 2125. This saga became the scaffolding for a rich and expansive world that was painstakingly developed over the course of several years.

The fundamental building blocks of the CODA Universe are its 100+ characters and its hyper-linked fragments of lore, which are inscribed permanently on-chain, and which serve as training and context for generative applications.

The CODA Universe will channel a vast swell of new capabilities to construct a massively multiplayer autonomous world and narrative experience that is native to this new media paradigm.

_100 years from now..._

A fractured world recovers from the lingering wounds of the Dark Decade. An authoritarian world power offers refuge from chaos in exchange for strict control. Technology is tightly regulated, protecting civilization from the demons of its past. Institutions, rebel nations, and vast criminal syndicates fight for scraps of power and privilege.&#x20;

And at the edges, in the underground, something new is taking form.

***

The world depicted in the CODA Universe is a super-collision of our possible futures. It is both strange and familiar. The notions of sci-fi encapsulated in the world and its themes are reflective of the challenges and dilemmas posed by encryption and privacy, decentralization, artificial intelligence, human nature, and the unresolvable tension between control and freedom, order and chaos.

~~The world is grounded by a layered history that has organically unfolded into a complex world order. The resulting conflict space is intended to serve as a dynamic medium of competing futures transposed into fictional avatars. Its key technologies are game-mechanic-friendly vectors for high-utility innovations that could fit within a reasonably plausible regime of science and engineering.~~

The world and its history are lined up in such a way that the future depicted in the CODA Universe is facing proxies for the very crises that we are set to face in our immediate and near-term future. It is meant to serve as an interactive Rorschach test, and an eschatological time capsule of our projections about the past, present, and future.

On January 1st, 2025, we will start the CODA Universe's clock. From that moment forward, the CODA Universe will always be set 100 years in our future, and its canon will be developed on-chain.

## Creator

The CODA Universe was created by [dxxmsdxy](https://www.twitter.com/dreeemtheartist/?hl=en), a pseudonym of one of the earliest builders and artists in crypto and ordinals, beginning in 2013. The CODA Universe is part of their continuing exploration of 'interpretable art'.&#x20;

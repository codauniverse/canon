# The Dark Decade

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/darkdecade.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A makeshift refugee camp during the Dark Decade.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

The ten year period spanning from [The Crash](the-crash.md) in August, 2052 until the [New Dawn Declaration](../gata/history/new-dawn-declaration.md) in November, 2062.

In The Crash, nearly every device on the planet with a general-purpose processor was irreparably corrupted, dealing an instant death blow to power, communications and the entire global supply chain, plunging the world into a brief, but perilous new dark age. Believed by many researchers to have been caused by the [Daemon Virus](../science-and-tech/the-daemon-virus.md).

The Dark Decade was a global event that instantly dissolved the existing world order, resulting in famine, disease, violence, and mass migrations, punctuated with more localized atrocities and environmental hazards.

During the first 6 months of the Dark Decade, 1.2 billion people lost their lives, primarily due to famine and disease. Over the following 9 years, an additional estimated 3 billion people perished due to causes attributed to the Dark Decade.

## Timeline of Events

* **August 2052, The Crash:** Sudden corruption of general-purpose processors globally, leading to the immediate collapse of power grids, communications, and supply chains.
* **Late 2052:** Rapid onset of famine and disease due to the breakdown of food distribution and healthcare systems, leading to widespread mortality.
* **Early 2053:** Emergence of localized gangs, warlords and factions vying for control over remaining resources, resulting in oppressive practices and cyclical violence.
* **Mid 2053:** Environmental disasters worsen as nuclear reactors, dams, and other critical infrastructure begin to fail, and ecological profiles shift without human influence, leading to additional destabilization. The [Joint Atlantic Command](../gata/history/the-joint-atlantic-command-jac.md) carries out missions around the world to address these existential threats.
* **2052-2056:** Mass migrations as people flee uninhabitable areas in search of food, water, and safety, exacerbating tensions in less affected regions.
* **2056:** The New Dawn Declaration and formal founding of [Atla](../gata/key-locations/atla.md) by the civilian and military population living in the Joint Atlantic Command flotilla. Atla begins to establish stable refugee camps across the Atlantic Ocean's coastal territories.
* **2056-2060:** Grassroots efforts to rebuild society begin to emerge, focusing on sustainable living and the re-establishment of local communities, laying the foundations for the eventual emergence of the [Free Territories](../free-territories/) movement.
* **2061:** Atla implements the first build of The System, a new model for infrastructure design prioritizing resilience and decentralization to avoid past vulnerabilities.
* **November 2062: The** [New Dawn Accords](../gata/politics/new-dawn-accords.md) are ratified by Atla and signed by many of the provisional governments of Atla's refugee camps. The [Greater Atlan Territorial Alliance](../gata/the-basics.md) is formed. Considered by many historical scholars to be the end of the Dark Decade, and the beginning of the [Reconstruction era](the-reconstruction.md).

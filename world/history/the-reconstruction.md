# The Reconstruction

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/reconstruction.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

A 40-year period of widespread recovery and reinvention, led by the awesome and terrifying technological supremacy of the fledging hegemon, [GATA](../gata/the-basics.md). These technological leaps were made possible by GATA's [secretive research programs](../gata/history/the-research-corps.md), unfettered under GATA's [Existence Doctrine](../gata/military-and-defense/existence-doctrine.md) policies.

A number of critical developments contributed to the success of the Reconstruction; the ubiquity of the genetically-engineered [Manna flower](../gata/history/the-manna-flower.md), the success of GATA's [System architecture](../gata/politics/the-system.md), the establishment of relatively stable ["districts"](../gata/politics/districts.md), the continued innovations pioneered by Atla's [Research Corps](../gata/history/the-research-corps.md), and the determined cooperation between GATA, [Aryabat](../aryabat/the-basics.md), the [African Union](../african-union/the-basics.md).

The Reconstruction era transmuted the fear and disarray of [the Dark Decade](the-dark-decade.md) into a renewed spirit of hope and cooperation. Remembered nostalgically by many as a euphoric period of relief, wonder, and possibility.

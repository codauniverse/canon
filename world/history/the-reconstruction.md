# The Reconstruction

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/reconstruction.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

A 40-year period of widespread recovery and reinvention, led by the awesome and terrifying technological supremacy of the fledging hegemon, [GATA](../gata/the-basics.md). These technological leaps were made possible by GATA's [secretive research programs](../sol/institutions/the-research-corps.md), unfettered under GATA's [Existence Doctrine](../gata/military-and-defense/existence-doctrine.md) policies.

A number of critical developments contributed to the success of the Reconstruction; the ubiquity of the genetically-engineered [Manna flower](../science-and-tech/the-manna-flower.md), the success of GATA's [System architecture](../gata/politics/the-system.md), the establishment of relatively stable ["districts"](../gata/politics/districts.md), the continued innovations pioneered by Atla's [Research Corps](../sol/institutions/the-research-corps.md), and the determined cooperation between GATA, [Aryabat](../aryabat/the-basics.md), the [African Union](../african-union/the-basics.md).

The Reconstruction era transmuted the fear and disarray of [the Dark Decade](the-dark-decade.md) into a renewed spirit of hope and cooperation. Remembered nostalgically by many as a euphoric period of relief, wonder, and possibility.

The Reconstruction era is held to have come to a close in the late 2090's with the [end of the Existence Doctrine](../gata/military-and-defense/existence-doctrine.md#the-end-of-the-existence-doctrine), which forced GATA to recognize its own stringent [tech regulations](../gata/law-and-order/tech-regulation.md).

This shift in policy was viewed by some as a step backwards, quickly halting a number of immense construction projects and pioneering scientific initiatives in order to more carefully guide the future of human civilization into the next century and beyond. As a result, there exist a large number of abandoned structures and defunct facilities scattered across [Greater Atla](../gata/politics/greater-atla.md), and Decommissioning Yards where retired technologies are safely disassembled, stored, or recycled.

Still, GATA's ultimate vision for human civilization remains unchanged, and the once-terrifying chorus of technologies and scientific wonders glimpsed under the Existence Doctrine remain promised along the path upon which GATA walks. But first, the peoples of the world must be united under their blue and white banner.

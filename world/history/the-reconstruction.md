## Overview

A 40-year period of widespread recovery and stabilization, led by the awesome and terrifying technological supremacy of the fledging hegemon, GATA. Made possible by the study of the mysterious Found Objects by the Research Corps, resulting in transformative new technologies.

The Reconstruction transmuted the fear and disarray of the Dark Decade into hope and cooperation. Considered by many to be humanity's greatest undertaking.

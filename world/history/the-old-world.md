# The Old World

## Overview

The mid-21st century prior to The Crash. Humanity seemed to be on the cusp of a new era of relative peace and prosperity in the wake of the tumultuous emergence of the world-changing technologies of the 30s and early 40s, including AGI, quantum computing, fusion energy, atomic fabrication, and genetic medicine.

Most daily social and economic interactions were mediated by an ever-complexifying mesh of autonomous agents who deftly negotiated the complex relationships between disparate peoples and interests, offering humanity a path out of the zero-sum mentality that had defined its past.

Still, political disagreements remained. A significant proportion of political discourse centered around AGI alignment, the role of government, the future of human purpose, the loss of privacy and anonymity, technological inequality, and our relationship with the virtual worlds in which people were spending increasingly more and more of their lives.

Larger political tensions also persisted between the East and West for dominance in critical domains like power, compute, and control over key resources in the oceans and in space.

In the efforts to resolve this friction, AGI served as a highly effective diplomatic tool, however its optimal solutions regarding geo-politics demanded radical policy shifts such as open AI alignment, demilitarization, decentralization of political authority, and the dissolution of traditional markets. However, the individuals in control of the most powerful governments and corporations refused to end practices that gave them some measure of perceived leverage and control.

These disagreements had ultimately manifested in two competing models in the West and the East. In the West where national governments had widely diminished in their power, there was a concerted effort to maintain traditional markets while decentralizing intelligence, governance and ownership through corporations. Meanwhile, many nations in the East more readily implemented integrated centralized intelligent systems to orchestrate society, markets, and strategic defense.

As a result, the West struggled to compete with the rate of advancement in the East. They also proved far more vulnerable to disinformation and political interference. In particular, lagging measures by corporations and government to secure the public's private personal data had left many highly vulnerable to extremely targeted attacks and manipulation, producing a chilling effect on public discourse and activism.

During this period immediately prior to The Crash, there was an increased frequency of lone-wolf terror attacks in the West. The majority of the individuals carrying out these acts were ideological fanatics—religious and secular—who believed corrupt trillionaires were depriving citizens of the prosperity seen in the East. After investigation, it was determined that many of these individuals had been radicalized by intelligent agents deployed by Eastern intelligence branches. After trading a series of retaliatory cyber attacks, a state of war was invoked by the West and NATO fleets were mobilized. A red line was declared.

In an effort to defuse the tense situation, a series of three international summits were set to outline a new plan for de-escalation and global cooperation. The first summit, though brief, was widely hailed as a success. Two weeks after the first summit was August 26, 2052; the day of The Crash.

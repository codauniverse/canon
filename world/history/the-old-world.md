# The Old World

## Overview

The world of the mid-21st century prior to The Crash. Humanity seemed to be on the cusp of a new era of relative peace and prosperity. Geo-political and economic conflicts were mediated by an ever-complexifying mesh of autonomous agents who deftly negotiated the complex relationships between disparate peoples and interests, taking human civilization out of the zero-sum mentality that had defined its past.

Countless new innovations revolutionized human life and reinvigorated a hope for a thriving future. Fusion power, quantum computers, cures for nearly all major diseases and disorders; the scientific and technological landscape was replete with invigorating insights that only reinforced the surging wave of progress.

## Past Tensions

While the Old World is often looked back on with a certain innocent pining by those who grew up after its end, it was not without its pivotal conflicts.

Tensions remained between the East and West for dominance over key resources in the oceans and in space. While AGI proved to be a transformative tool, its optimal solutions regarding international governance tended towards power structures that conflicted with the interests of entrenched powers, such as open AI alignment, demilitarization, and the dissolution of traditional markets. Many governments and other powerful organizations refused to relinquish these practices that they believed gave them some measure of leverage against one another.

Culturally, there were also many fundamental disagreements about the role of government, the future of human purpose, and our relationship with the virtual worlds in which people were spending increasingly more and more of their lives. These disagreements had manifested in two competing models in the West and the East. In the West where national governments held far less power, there was a concerted effort to maintain traditional markets while decentralizing governance and ownership through corporations, many nations in the East more readily implementing intelligent systems to orchestrate society.

This had begun to pose major challenges for Liberal democracies in the West, where they were more vulnerable to intelligence warfare. In particular, lagging measures by businesses and governments to secure the public's private personal data had left many highly vulnerable to extremely targeted attacks and manipulation, producing a chilling effect on public discourse and activism.

During this period immediately prior to The Crash, there was an increased frequency of lone-wolf terror attacks in the West. The majority of the individuals carrying out these acts were ideological fanatics, religious and secular, who rejected some aspect of the emerging world order. It is believed that many of these attacks had been intelligently coordinated.

In response to these mounting challenges, reforms were underway throughout the world at the time of The Crash.

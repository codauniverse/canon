# The Old World

## Overview

The world of the mid-21st century prior to The Crash. Humanity seemed to be on the cusp of a new era of relative peace and prosperity. Geo-political and economic conflicts were mediated by an ever-complexifying mesh of autonomous agents who deftly negotiated the complex relationships between disparate peoples and interests, taking human civilization out of the zero-sum mentality that had defined its past.

Countless new innovations revolutionized human life and reinvigorated a hope for a thriving future. Fusion power, quantum computers, cures for nearly all major diseases and disorders; the scientific and technological landscape was replete with invigorating insights that only reinforced the surging wave of progress.

## Past Conflicts

While the Old World is often looked back on with a certain innocent pining by those who grew up after its end, it was not without its conflicts.

Tensions remained between the East and West for dominance over key resources in the oceans and in space. While AGI proved to be a transformative tool, its optimal solutions regarding international governance emphasized demilitarization and the dissolution of traditional markets. Many governments and other powerful organizations refused to relinquish the threat of armed conflict and other practices that gave them some measure of leverage.

There were also many fundamental disagreements about the role of government, the future of human purpose, and our relationship with the virtual worlds where people were spending increasingly more and more of their lives.

During the period prior to The Crash, there was also an increased frequency of lone-wolf terror attacks that perversely turned new and powerful advancements into devastating horrors. Many of the individuals carrying out these acts were ideological fanatics, religious and secular, who rejected some aspect of the emerging world order.

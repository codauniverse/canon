# The Crash

## Overview

The onset of the [Dark Decade](the-dark-decade.md) is called "The Crash", sometimes also referred to somberly as “Sunset” in [GATA](../gata/); the moment the light of the [Old World](the-old-world.md) slipped beneath the horizon.

When the lights went out, and communications failed, people in all corners of the world were plunged into darkness. For most, from the chambers of power, to the halls of hospitals, the circumstances were immediately dire. Large urban centers quickly devolved into chaos, resulting in mass flight into the surrounding areas, resulting in countless tragic encounters between desperate and frightened civilians. Contingencies were activated. A terrifying state of nature soon took root. The following weeks and months would only see conditions continue to deteriorate.

Without food, medicine, and analog redundancies for key civilizational infrastructure like markets and&#x20;

The Crash was the most confusing and chaotic period of the Dark Decade, as no one understood the scale, severity, or cause of the crisis as it was unfolding.

# The Crash

## Overview

The onset of the [Dark Decade](the-dark-decade.md) is called "The Crash", sometimes also referred to somberly as “Sunset” in [GATA](../gata/), when the light of the [Old World](the-old-world.md) slipped beneath the horizon.

When the lights went out, and communications failed, people in all corners of the world were plunged into darkness. For many, from the chambers of power, to the halls of hospitals, the circumstances were immediately dire. Contingencies were activated. Panic quickly took hold. The following weeks and months would only see conditions continue to deteriorate.

The Crash was the most confusing and chaotic period of the Dark Decade, as no one understood the scale, severity, or cause of the crisis as it was unfolding.

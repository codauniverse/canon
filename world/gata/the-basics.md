## Overview

Founded in Atla, which originated as a floating colony of naval ships in the Atlantic Ocean during the Dark Decade.

GATA governs a large geographic region around much of the Atlantic Ocean known as Greater Atla, however its influence reaches far beyond its borders.

Most of GATA‚Äôs districts originate from major Atlan refugee camps prior to and during The Reconstruction.

Utilizes a secure, automated logistical infrastructure called ‚ÄúThe System‚Äù to mediate its supply chain, governance, and economy.

Concentrated in 72 districts of varying size, each with its own distinct technological ‚Äòparadigm‚Äô.

GATA guarantees the needs of its citizens but imposes stringent laws, fostering a dichotomous existence of muted stability for its citizens.

# Guardians

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/guardians.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A Guardian operative and her Combat Gear.</p></figcaption></figure>

## **Overview**

[Angelis](angelis.md)â€™ special forces units. Guardians undergo rigorous training and conditioning, and demonstrate mastery of a wide range of skills including hand-to-hand combat, use of multiple firearms and weapon platforms, link proficiency, and advanced ability with [Combat Gear](../../science-and-tech/gear.md#combat-gear).&#x20;

Guardian units are deployed in squads of 5-20, and are sometimes supported with a squadron of up to 200 standard infantry as support.

Guardians are identifiable by their blue Gear, which are often in the mid-size to large size range, and are outfitted for trans-medium operations that span land, air, sea and space. Guardians and their infantry support are the blunt force weapon of Angelis.

# Guardians

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/guardians.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A Guardian operative and her Combat Gear.</p></figcaption></figure>

## **Overview**

[Angelis](angelis.md)â€™ mechanized special forces units, Guardians are the blunt force weapon of Angelis, contrasted by the versatility of [Rapid Response](rapid-response.md), and the precision of the [MAVs](mavs.md). Guardians undergo rigorous training and conditioning, and demonstrate mastery of a wide range of skills including hand-to-hand combat, use of multiple firearms and weapon platforms, [link proficiency](../../science-and-tech/links.md), and advanced ability with Heavy [Combat Gear](../../science-and-tech/gear.md#combat-gear).&#x20;

Guardian units are typically deployed in fireteams of four, often complemented by a company or battalion of regular infantry, as well as aerial support, however it is not uncommon for Guardians to be deployed solo to support active engagements on the ground, such as Gate Patrol operations, or partner-state conflicts.

Guardians are identifiable by their blue Heavy Gear, which are often in the mid-size to large-size range, and are outfitted with [statics](../../science-and-tech/statics.md) for trans-medium operations that span land, air, sea and space. They can be deployed directly from Angelis [Watchtowers](angelis.md#watchtowers) and [Overlooks](angelis.md#overlooks) located in Low Earth Orbit.

## History

During the Reconstruction era, while GATA still maintained a national military (technically, an extra-territorial extension of Atla's local authority), one of their signature tactics was to deploy heavy, mechanized units to protect each of their refugee camps and nascent districts. The primary purpose of these heavy units was as a deterrence to local Sovereign militias.

It was during this time that GATA's citizens would begin to refer to these imposing masses of metal as "guardian angels".

Later, following the end of the Existence Doctrine and subsequent formation of Angelis, the Guardians branch was established by Angelis as a direct continuation of these stalwart protectors, and are in fact the inspiration for Angelis' very name.

Equipped with advanced technology and heavy weaponry, Guardians have since been known to dominate high-intensity combat scenarios. Their heavy loadouts and tactical versatility have seen them deployed in response to a wide range of threats and missions. To this day, the deployment of Guardians is often seen as a signal of GATA's commitment to a conflict or operation.

## Deployment and Operations

Guardians are typically deployed in fireteams of four, though their numbers can vary depending on the mission requirements. They are often complemented by a company or battalion of regular infantry and supported by aerial units for comprehensive battlefield dominance. In addition to their primary role in direct engagements, Guardians are frequently deployed solo to support active ground operations, such as Gate Patrol operations or partner-state conflicts. Their ability to operate independently or as part of a larger force makes them versatile assets in GATA's military strategy.

Guardians are typically deployed as a deterrent intended to discourage enemy advancements or attacks, so the consequences of an incursion into their operational domain must be swift and consequential. As a result, the Guardians are famously known for two things; waiting patiently, and striking ferociously. Once engaged, Guardians unleash their overwhelming force on targets, causing rapid and unrelenting devastation.

Guardian teams work in concert, thanks to advanced link syncing capabilities, to decisively extinguish their target's means and will to fight. Even after defeating a target, Guardian's are trained to disable and dismantle as much of their enemy's hardware and equipment as possible, with the aim to reduce the "latent threat" to zero.

In addition to being deployed as deterrents, Guardian's are sometimes dispatched to active combat and crisis zones. Guardians' ability to be rapidly deployed from orbit allows for swift responses to emerging threats. Their presence can quickly stabilize volatile situations and provide immediate support to ground forces. However, due to their blunt tactics and cumbersome size, there are many situations for which Guardian's are not an appropriate solution.

## Equipment and Technology

Guardians are equipped with the most advanced technology available in GATA, thanks to Angelis' special paradigm, availing to them a wider range of technologies produced by GATA's many district's private enterprises:

### Combat Gear

Their iconic blue Heavy Gear is designed for mid-size to large-size frames, offering enhanced protection and heavy loadouts. The gear is integrated with statics for trans-medium operations, allowing Guardians to seamlessly transition between land, air, sea, and space environments. At the heart of each Guardian Gear is a rudimentary COG managing many of the Guardian's subsystems in concert with the actions of the pilot.

Each Guardian's gear is tailored to their specific mission requirements, featuring cutting-edge technology such as enhanced sensory interfaces, augmented reality displays, and adaptive camouflage. This gear is designed to provide maximum operational efficiency and survivability in diverse combat scenarios.

### **Weaponry**

Guardians have access to a wide array of firearms and weapon platforms, including energy weapons, kinetic firearms, and specialized ordinance for various combat situations. Their proficiency with multiple weapon systems allows them to adapt to changing battlefield conditions and effectively neutralize threats.

### Enhancements

#### **Quantum Communication**

With the development of Quantum Seeds, Guardians now have access to instantaneous communication across vast distances, enhancing coordination and strategic planning.

## Training and Skills

The training regimen for the Guardians is one of the most demanding and comprehensive in the world. It includes:

* **Hand-to-Hand Combat**: As with all Angelis infantry and special forces, Guardian operatives are trained in multiple martial arts and close-quarters combat techniques, ensuring they can engage effectively in melee situations.
* **Firearms and Weapon Platforms**: Proficiency with a broad range of firearms and heavy weapon platforms is essential. Guardians are trained to use everything from personal sidearms to large-scale ordinance with precision.
* **Heavy Weapons and Equipment:** Proficiency with an arsenal of heavy ordinance, canons, and equipment that can be outfitted on Guardian Combat Gear.
* **Link Proficiency**: Advanced training in Link use allows Guardians to enhance their integration with their Combat Gear, their situational awareness, and their communication with the rest of their fireteam. They can interface with various systems, control drones, and access real-time battlefield data.
* **Combat Gear Mastery**: Guardians are experts in using and maneuvering their advanced Heavy Combat Gear, leveraging its full capabilities to gain a decisive tactical edge. This includes the use of static-powered mobility, augmented reality displays, adaptive camouflage, defensive counter-measures, and enhanced sensory interfaces.

# The Basics

## Overview

From its inception, [Atla](../key-locations/atla.md) had always maintained a formidable standing military. While it operated across the globe and served as GATA's de facto national military, this formidable fighting force was technically an extra-territorial extension of the Atlan district's local authority forces.

In the wake of [The Reconstruction](../../history/the-reconstruction.md), and with the end of the [Existence Doctrine](existence-doctrine.md), the national military was officially dissolved. In its place, the public enterprise [Angelis](angelis.md) was forged, formalizing or fine-tuning many of its provisional structures, policies and practices. Much of GATA's military personnel and equipment were transferred to this new organization, and several of its operational compartments were formalized into distinct branches, such as the [Guardians](guardians.md), [Rapid Response](rapid-response.md), [MAVs](mavs.md), and [Watchers](angelis.md#watchers).

Its most advanced weapons and technologies were decommissioned in accordance with [the AIC](../institutions/atlan-information-control-aic.md)’s formal interpretation of [NDA](../politics/new-dawn-accords.md) regulations. Many of GATA's most vocal critics had been skeptical that GATA would follow through with this self-censure, however they did just that.

Today, GATA does not have a monolithic standing national military. Instead, Each of GATA’s major administrative bodies have armed branches to serve their mandates.

The [First Quorum](../politics/governance.md#the-first-quorum) serves as the board of [Angelis](angelis.md), an unrivalled martial public [enterprise](../enterprise/) based in Atla, in protecting GATA’s territorial interests across all of [Greater Atla](../politics/greater-atla.md), and beyond.

[The AIC](../institutions/atlan-information-control-aic.md) oversees [Collections](../law-and-order/collections.md), an armed enforcement branch for AIC law in accordance with the NDA, as well as [Border Patrol](../borders-and-travel/gate-patrol.md), the border enforcement for GATA’s many [districts](../politics/districts.md).

Each district's [local government](../politics/districts.md#local-government) oversees their [local authority](../law-and-order/local-authority.md), which primarily servers as law enforcement within the district, however during the early Reconstruction, these local authorities functioned more like local militias. To this day, many districts maintain a highly-trained, combat-focused contingent in order to counteract terrorist attacks, violent organized crime, and [Free Territory](../../free-territories/) aggressions.

The [Second Quorum](../politics/governance.md#the-second-quorum) directs the Reserve Protocol, which allows [District Representatives](../politics/governance.md#district-representative) to request the temporarily re-allocation of [Local Authority](../law-and-order/local-authority.md) personnel between districts. Reserve requests are more and more common and typically approved without issue.

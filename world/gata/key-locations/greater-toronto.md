# Greater Toronto

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/greatertoronto-589.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A view of Greater Toronto's famed forest city.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

GATA's second district, formed from its largest North American refugee camp. The Greater Toronto refugee camp grew to support a large population of people who had come to live in the Great Lakes region over the course of the Dark Decade. Known for its lush greenery, a cultivated remnant of nature's reclamation of the city during the Dark Decade, its towering cityscape interwoven by elevated promenades, as well as its iconic Steps rising from Lake Ontario.

## The Steps

The Steps, as they are referred to in Greater Toronto, are immense Atlan staging platforms left over from the Reconstruction days. These platforms were built off the coast in the lake to allow GATA to deliver large shipments of materials and other resources to the fledgling district. This was necessary because even GATA is beholden to its own laws, thus nearby gray zones were often utilized as staging areas where the possession and use of unparadigmed tech was technically not a crime. When static platforms were paradigmed into the district there was no more need to ferry System shipments from the “grey zone” platforms into the city.

The Steps saw a brief repurposing during the late Reconstruction's boom when private enterprise was permitted in the district and the free market opened back up across GATA. The Steps were an enticing location for enterprise because the Steps have no paradigm, allowing them to use and trade various technologies with fewer restrictions.&#x20;

However, increasing tensions with Free Territory sympathizers in the Great Lakes region resulted in a series of deadly raids on the Steps and the theft of expensive fabricators, among other goods. As a result, Greater Toronto’s local government tightened their enforcement of district borders at the orders of Atla and the Steps once again fell into disuse. Plans have been proposed over the years to convert them into a garden monument.&#x20;

### Resurgence in Use

Recently the local youth have begun taking statics out to the offshore platforms to throw raves outside of the district's paradigm. So far, while their escapades have frustrated local officials who have no jurisdiction on The Steps, the situation has not yet warranted the attention of any Atla’s enforcement arms or GATA's democratic institutions.

# Atla

## Overview

The capital and most influential district in the [Greater Atlan Territorial Alliance (GATA)](../the-basics.md). Originally founded from a [floating colony of naval ships](../history/the-joint-atlantic-command-jac.md) during [the Dark Decade](../../history/the-dark-decade.md), Atla has since evolved into a vast sea-set metropolis reaching above and below the waves roughly 1,600 km West of the Strait of Gibraltar.

Its strategic location in the Atlantic Ocean and its pivotal role in the history and governance of [Greater Atla](../politics/greater-atla.md) make it a focal point of global politics, power and intrigue. From is submersible seascrapers and underwater plazas, to its static levies, or the flocks of static vehicles weaving through its skies, Atla is truly a sight to behold.

### Static Levies

Encircling Atla is an array of tens of thousands of static levies, long tube-shaped field generators that use gravity to manipulate and repel the ocean's mighty waves. Over the years, Atla's growing mastery of its oceanic setting is an overt assertion that it can and will fulfill its mandate to tame the Earth system.

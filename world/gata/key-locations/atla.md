## Overview

Atla is the capital and most influential district within the [Greater Atlantic Territorial Alliance (GATA)](../the-basics.md). Originally founded as a [floating colony of naval ships](../history/the-joint-atlantic-command-jac.md) during [the Dark Decade](../../history/the-dark-decade.md), Atla has since evolved into a vast sea-set metropolis reaching above and below the waves roughly 1,600 km West of the Strait of Gibraltar. Its strategic location in the Atlantic Ocean and its pivotal role in the history and governance of [Greater Atla](../politics/greater-atla.md) make it a focal point of global power and intrigue.

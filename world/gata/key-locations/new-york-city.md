# New York City

## Overview

One of the largest cities in GATA. Despite the fact that New York City's local government applied for districthood in 2098, and was subsequently approved by the Second Quorum, the city does not yet meet the System Requirements for districthood outlined in the New Dawn Accords.

Residents call it "The Second City" on account of the city's resurrection. In the wake of the Crash, and as a result of a series of hurricanes and rising sea levels, much of the city has remained flooded, transforming the metropolis into a canal city.

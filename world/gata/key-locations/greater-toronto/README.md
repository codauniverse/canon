# Greater Toronto

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/greatertoronto-589.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A view of Greater Toronto's famed forest city.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

[The Greater Atlan Territorial Alliance (GATA)'s](../../the-basics.md) second [district](../../politics/districts.md), formed from its largest North American refugee camp. The Greater Toronto refugee camp grew to support a large population of survivors who had come to live in the Great Lakes region over the course of [the Dark Decade](../../../history/the-dark-decade.md).

Known for its lush greenery, a cultivated remnant of nature's reclamation of the city during the Dark Decade, its towering cityscape interwoven by elevated promenades, as well as its iconic [Steps](the-steps.md) rising from Lake Ontario.

The city is a thriving hub of private enterprise, and one of the most stable and prosperous districts in all of GATA.

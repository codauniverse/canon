# Governance

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/quorums.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A politician making an appeal in the Second Quorum.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

[GATA](../) employs a unique form of governance that can be defined as "Cybernetic Democracy." This model was instituted in 2061 and spans across regions including North America, South America, Western Europe, and North Africa.

The foundation of GATA's political and national apparatus is a highly sophisticated and secure automated logistical framework called "[The System](the-system.md)," which underpins not only the supply chain and economy but also the governance of GATA.

GATA's governance is a sophisticated blend of automation and representative decision-making, structured into three distinct but interconnected Quorums. Each Quorum plays a unique and vital role in maintaining the balance and functionality of GATA's societal structure.

The System autonomously reacts to democratic inputs from the [Three Quorums](governance.md#leadership) as well as other signals across its network, and seamlessly enforces GATA regulations and policies.

## The Three Pillars

The "Three Pillars" of GATA’s governance are the Quorums, [the AIC](../institutions/atlan-information-control-aic.md), and The System. Each of these parts play an integral role in maintaining GATA’s expansive regime.

The Quorums make the decisions, the AIC drafts and adjudicates laws enforcing the [New Dawn Accords](new-dawn-accords.md), and The System automatically enforces its requirements and executes its hard-coded functions.

The term "Three Pillars" is intended to represent the understanding that GATA’s citizens are the Fourth Pillar. However, within the halls of power, the unspoken “Fourth Pillar” is widely understood to be [ALTAR](../institutions/altar.md).

Many with their own agendas often facetiously posit GATA’s "Fourth Pillar" to be whatever benefits them most, ranging from God, the [Yield](yield.md), righteousness, and so on.

## Structure

### **The First Quorum**

This council of seven members is the pinnacle of GATA's governance. They are elected by the [Second Quorum](governance.md#the-second-quorum), and their appointment is lifelong, although their [key-based](keys.md) voting permissions can be revoked or reassigned by the Second Quorum.

Council members typically serve for about ten years before grooming a replacement, usually from the ranks of the Second Quorum, and retiring. The First Quorum is based in Luna.

The First Quorum holds significant influence, overseeing major policy decisions and the overarching direction of GATA, akin to a governing board. Their role is to safeguard GATA's future, and when they intercede in Second Quorum matters, it is generally when near-term and long-term interests are in conflict.

Their mandate is to ensure the stability, security, and continuing incorporation of districts in the ever-expanding territory of Greater Atla. They must respect the consensus of the Third Quorum's ["Optima"](governance.md#the-third-quorum) when constructing their policies and making decisions. The First Quorum directs GATA's foreign policy, and GATA's ambassadors work directly under the First Quorum.

They have the exclusive authority to direct [Angelis](../military-and-defense/angelis.md) and approve Angelis support requested by the Second Quorum.

They work closely with the AIC [Chairperson](../institutions/atlan-information-control-aic.md#leadership-and-governance), the Director of [Systema](../enterprise/systema.md), and [ALTAR](../institutions/altar.md) leadership in constructing their projections and plans for the future.

The First Quorum is afforded a high degree to autonomy and secrecy in their decision making.

### **The Second Quorum**

Comprising elected representatives from each of GATA’s [districts](districts.md), the Second Quorum is based in Atla and acts as a bridge between the diverse interests of GATA’s districts. The number of representatives per district varies, reflecting relative population sizes but not strictly proportional to it.

The Second Quorum is pivotal in voicing and projecting the unique needs and interests of GATA’s districts, homesteads, and unincorporated populaces. It is key to GATA’s distributed governance, from shaping common domestic policies, to oversight of [enterprise](../enterprise/), or promoting peace and order domestically. Their role is to oversee the near-term prosperity and peace within and between GATA's districts, and support the incorporation process of new districts.

The Second Quorum also propose and approve bounties that are funded from [System Yield](yield.md) surplus, giving the governing body a unique way to incentivize certain outcomes, or encourage new enterprise.

The Second Quorum also provides a setting for direct diplomacy between districts. In the halls of [Atla](../key-locations/atla.md)’s bureaucratic maze, representatives and other keyholders of the state will negotiate trades and partnerships to meet needs that the System can’t address.

### **The Third Quorum**

The most expansive and inclusive, this Quorum comprises every citizen of GATA. Through [System Terminals](the-system.md#system-terminals), citizens vote on key issues affecting their districts, and broader policies across GATA.

The decisions presented to the Third Quorum are concerned with the immediate, local present, and the distant, common future. Citizens are able to immediately voice their sentiment in reaction to Second Quorum and First Quorum policies, providing a critical signal for representatives and The System.

This direct democratic practice ensures a healthy level of citizen engagement and representation in the governance process, and is critical in bolstering the legitimacy of GATA's government.

#### The Third Quorum's Optima

The Third Quorum is also are responsible for the "Optima", which is the aggregated and ever-shifting vision for GATA's 100-year future. The Optima is aggregated from a continuous survey gathering critical data about what citizens want and demand for the future.

The Optima is one of the most powerful concepts in GATA's governance, informing the deliberations of the First and Second Quorum, providing a transparent and comprehensive reference for weighing priorities in critical decisions.

## Key Positions

### High Councilor

Members of the First Quorum, wielding considerable power and responsibility in steering GATA's policies and future.

### District Representative

A member of the Second Quorum, acting as the voice of their district. Sometimes referred to as governors. Representatives are the go-between for their district’s local government and GATA’s central government.

District Representatives also work with the First Quorum and the AIC Liaison to define, enforce and expand district paradigms.

### System Administrator

These individuals oversee the technical integrity and security of "The System" within their district, ensuring it functions efficiently for governance, economy, and logistics.

They are the main bridge between their district, the AIC, and Systema. They are appointed by their District Representatives.

### AIC Liaison

Responsible for communication and coordination between the First Quorum, Second Quorum, and the AIC.

### ALTAR Speaker

One selected member of ALTAR’s council who is responsible for all remote and in-person communications between ALTAR and GATA leadership.

## Functioning

### **Policy Making**

Policies are often initiated in the Second Quorum, and refined and ratified by the First Quorum. Citizen input is solicited through the Third Quorum for key issues. It is rare for major policy changes to make it through the First Quorum, as GATA’s government is intended to be mostly administrative.

Local governments retain enough authority that, as long as they are not in conflict with GATA’s comprehensive regulatory framework, they can address policy needs at the local level with the support of the Second Quorum’s resources.

### **Enforcement and Implementation**

Once policies are ratified, the Second Quorum works with the AIC liaison to develop the new policies into a form that can be implemented into The System by Systema.

These changes are typically targeted at key districts of concern and can take quite some time to propagate across other districts and paradigms.

### **Feedback and Adaptation**

Continuous feedback from citizens through the System terminals allows for dynamic and responsive consensus-making, however changes to The System are slow and the actual laws that are implemented are minimal in their description, but unyielding in their absolute stricture.

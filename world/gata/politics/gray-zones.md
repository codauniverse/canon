# Gray Zones

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/greyzone.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A Gray Zone outside of a district's walls.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

The term Gray Zone refers to any contiguous region inside of the territory of [Greater Atla](greater-atla.md) where [The System](../enterprise/systema.md) has not been adopted, or its requirements have not been met.&#x20;

Over time, the number of Gray Zones within Greater Atla and [NDA](new-dawn-accords.md)-compliant states has decreased, however the conflicts over those Gray Zones’ status grow ever sharper. [GATA](../)’s approach with Gray Zones is one of consistent pressure by various non-violent means, and patient absorption.

Occasionally, peacekeeping missions are undertaken by [Angelis forces](../military-and-defense/angelis.md), creating opportune conditions for the zone’s incorporation into GATA.

As far as GATA political ideology is concerned, all of the [Free Territories](../../free-territories/) are simply Gray Zones; illegitimate states occupying the land of Greater Atla, subject to its laws, but with no lawful delegate for authority.

## **People & Politics**

While many living in the Gray Zones identify with the Free Territories’ Sovereign movement, other Gray Zone communities are not especially political, and some do voluntarily maintain institutions that enforce and report according to GATA regulation, stopping short of actually signing their freedom over to the [New Dawn Accords](new-dawn-accords.md).&#x20;

Other Gray Zones have signed the NDA but do not meet minimum System requirements, such as satisfying reporting standards, or having sufficient citizen trust scores for their prospective local governments.

Gray Zones take many shapes and sizes, from expansive rural communities, to troubled cities, or even small city-block sized zones nestled within walled [districts](districts.md).

## **The Rule of Law**

In Gray Zones, there is no [Local Authority](../law-and-order/local-authority.md) with jurisdiction to enforce GATA law. Occasionally, Local Authority will contract skilled [Operators](../enterprise/operators.md) to conduct operations in Gray Zones, which is technically [permissible under GATA law](../enterprise/operators.md#deputized-operators), although frowned upon in the [Second Quorum](governance.md#the-second-quorum), and comes at a political cost.

[Border Patrol](../borders-and-travel/gate-patrol.md) are deployed to Gray Zones for incidents involving GATA’s citizens to conduct sieges and extraction operations.

[The AIC](../institutions/atlan-information-control.md) deploys [Collections](../law-and-order/collections.md) all around the world in its pursuit of dangerous technology, including Gray Zones.

On rare occasions, [Angelis](../military-and-defense/angelis.md) [Guardians](../military-and-defense/angelis.md#guardians) are deployed to Gray Zones by the [First Quorum](governance.md#the-first-quorum) for matters of national security and Class 1 violations of the New Dawn Accords.

More often than not, the only real laws in Gray Zones are the laws of the [local gangs](../criminal-element/gangs.md) and illegal enterprises known as [syndicates](../criminal-element/syndicates.md).

### **The Criminal Element**

In Gray Zones you will find a seedy ecosystem replete with brothels, illegal gambling, unlicensed [operators](../enterprise/operators.md), and [scavengers](../criminal-element/scavengers.md) selling [illegal tech](../law-and-order/tech-regulation.md) and [Old World](../../history/the-old-world.md) paraphernalia.

Local gangs are the law in Gray Zones and their say goes. Some gangs have more reasonable regimes than others. [Smuggling](../criminal-element/smugglers.md), [drugs](../criminal-element/drug-trade.md), and illegal rackets writhe beneath the surface of every day life, a network of underground alliances between syndicates, gangs, [enterprises](../enterprise/) and even [institutions](../institutions/), maintaining a different kind of order than GATA might provide.&#x20;

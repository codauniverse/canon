# Whole Privacy Protection (WPP)

## **Overview**

The Whole Privacy Protection Act (WPP) is a cornerstone piece of legislation in [Greater Atla Territorial Alliance (GATA)](../the-basics.md). It was one of the first major laws introduced by the [Atlan Information Control (AIC)](../institutions/atlan-information-control-aic.md) and ratified by the [First Quorum](governance.md#the-first-quorum), governing data privacy, encryption, and the ethical use of technology across the GATA.

Compliance with the WPP is mandatory for any nation wishing to adopt the [CRED currency](money.md#credits-currency) within their own [districts](districts.md), making it a fundamental requirement for signatories of the [New Dawn Accords (NDA)](new-dawn-accords.md).

***

## **Purpose**

The purpose of the WPP is to protect GATA's citizens, [institutions](../institutions/), and [enterprises](../enterprise/), from systemic risks by providing security through obscurity, and guaranteeing their right to "a natural life" that is not lived under a perpetual gaze.

The importance of legislation like the WPP was made apparent in the final decades of the [Old World](../../history/the-old-world.md), where a lack of such regulation resulted in serious security vulnerabilities for institutions and the general public, from the targeting of economic and political adversaries, surveillance markets, and surreptitious manipulation to critical data leaks and a destructive decline in social and civic engagement for fear of reprisal.

### **Data Privacy and Consent**

At the heart of the WPP is the principle of data privacy and user consent. The act stipulates that performing any operation on a citizen's data without their explicit consent is illegal.

Citizens are granted the right to revoke access to their data at any time, ensuring ongoing control over their personal information. This provision empowers individuals to manage their digital footprint actively and ensures that their privacy is respected across [the System](the-system.md).

### **Regulation of Data Analysis**

The WPP imposes stringent regulations on the aggregation and use of composite data sets. Combining data from disparate sources for analysis or processing is heavily restricted to prevent misuse and unauthorized data aggregation. All data analysis must be performed on licensed hard-coded systems with a WPP compliant filter.

This measure is designed to protect citizens, interest groups, and other populations, from potential abuses of their personal information and ensure that data is used ethically.

### **Behavior Modification Restrictions**

One of the critical elements of the WPP is its prohibition of behavior modification algorithms unless they explicitly serve the user's interests.&#x20;

This aspect of the act ensures that all algorithms are hard-coded, transparent and beneficial to the user, preventing manipulative practices that could exploit individuals. Audits of the hard code for algorithms over a certain size are mandatory, and are performed by licensed operators.

By outlawing unethical behavior modification, the WPP upholds the integrity of user interactions, limits potential damage from campaigns of manipulation, and maintains the broader trust in the System.

## **Impact on Technology and Crime**

The stringent data protection measures of the WPP have significantly impacted how computational platforms are designed and used within GATA.

Due to the high regulatory friction in transmitting sensitive information and the constant threat of criminal syndicates seeking valuable data, there has been a marked shift toward localized, massive computational platforms.

This shift minimizes the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure.

### **Enforcement**

Enforcement of the WPP is carried out by various bodies within GATA, with the [Collections bureau](../law-and-order/collections.md) playing a central role. Collections is dedicated to tracking and recovering illegal technology, ensuring that all technological use complies with the act's stringent requirements. If an illegal data farming operation is discovered, or a critical data breach occurs, it is Collections who will be called to address it.

The local government and local authority also both play crucial roles in upholding and enforcing WPP regulation, with their investigations often being the catalyst for discovering illegal data-related crime in their district.

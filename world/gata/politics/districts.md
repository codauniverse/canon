# Districts

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/districts.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A System Node facility in the heart of a district.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

Districts are highly secure territories with strict borders and regulations. Districts are the future vision of [GATA](../)'s civilizational design, as articulated in the [New Dawn Accords](new-dawn-accords.md)–jurisdictions fully integrated with [The System](the-system.md) where new technologies and prosperous futures can be safely pursued.

Districts have democratically elected local governments and [Second Quorum](governance.md#the-second-quorum) representatives, sometimes referred to as governors. Local government oversees the [Local Authority](../law-and-order/local-authority.md) in its upholding of GATA law. Local governments also oversee the distribution of the district’s [System Yield](yield.md).

Districts have been incorporated into The System and adhere to the regulations of the [New Dawn Accords](new-dawn-accords.md) as interpreted by [the AIC](../institutions/atlan-information-control.md). By using The System, districts automatically report key metrics which are used to inform wider System operations, such as the automated supply chain, Yield calculations, and to confirm a district’s continued compliance with System requirements and laws.

## Local Government

The administration of a district is overseen by the local government. Local governments are district-specific institutions that are born out of the [district incorporation process](districts.md#the-path-to-districthood).&#x20;

Local governments enact GATA's laws and regulations on behalf of GATA, direct the [Local Authority](../law-and-order/local-authority.md) in the enforcement of those laws, distribute [System Yield](yield.md), and work closely with the district's [Second Quorum](governance.md#the-second-quorum) [representatives](governance.md#district-representative) to ensure the district's needs are being met by [Atla](../key-locations/atla.md)'s legislators.&#x20;

The local government can also establish its own bylaws that can add to the existing legal framework of GATA, but cannot negate or override GATA's laws. In principle, the local government's legislative policies are reigned in by their constituency's continuing approval.

The structure of the local government is largely dependent on the community and political organizations that formed their foundations. From refugee camp organizers, to local school administrators, or community defense brigades and even [gangs](../criminal-element/gangs.md), the founding character of the local governments (and, by extension, the Local Authority that they deputize) vary substantially and inform their operation and relationship with their constituencies.

### Leadership

The head of the local government is typically a mayor, however some districts have a council of ministers at its head, a handful employ a more direct-democratic structure, and there are even a few districts in which the local government is merged with the [Local Authority](../law-and-order/local-authority.md).

The local government is legitimized by votes of confidence from its citizens via the [Third Quorum](governance.md#the-third-quorum). If a local government falls below the minimum confidence score outlined in the System Requirements, it is in jeopardy of losing [Yield](yield.md), having its [paradigm](paradigms.md) tightened, and/or other sanctions dictated by the [Second Quorum](governance.md#the-second-quorum).

## Borders, Import & Export

Districts have fully-privileged [Gates](../borders-and-travel/gates.md) which receive regular Yield shipments automated by The System, and facilitate travel between districts for those with the requisite [keys](keys.md).&#x20;

District borders are enforced by [Field Walls](../borders-and-travel/field-walls.md) and [Border Patrol](../borders-and-travel/gate-patrol.md). Field walls are walls of light that detect all activity crossing their path and notify [Angelis](../military-and-defense/angelis.md) [Watchers](../military-and-defense/angelis.md#watchers) who relay illegal wall transit to Border Patrol.

Field walls are often supplemented with numerous additional deterrents and security measures to discourage illegal transit.

It is nearly impossible to enter a district without being detected and intercepted, however some unlawful [operators](../enterprise/operators.md) known as [Wallrunners](../criminal-element/wallrunners.md) have made a profession of breaching district borders.

## **The Path to Districthood**

New districts are incorporated into GATA every year. The process to become a district is relatively straightforward, but very intensive. The minimum population for a new district is 1 million citizens and the maximum is 10 million, however these restrictions are only a guideline. Prospective districts must elect a provisional local government to represent their populace, who must then formally apply for districthood. If accepted by the [Second Quorum](governance.md#the-second-quorum), and approved by [the AIC](../institutions/atlan-information-control.md), onboarding begins.

A delegate is selected from the Second Quorum to advise on the ground in the prospective district, and they work together with the AIC, [Systema](../enterprise/systema.md) staff and the local government to ensure that the district is on the path to meet System Requirements for reporting and [NDA](new-dawn-accords.md) compliance.

This involves the installation of a [System Node](the-system.md#system-nodes), System [endpoints](../../science-and-tech/endpoints.md) and [terminals](the-system.md#system-terminals), the licensing of all legal [enterprises](../enterprise/), the establishment of a [Local Authority](../law-and-order/local-authority.md), and the collection of all [illegal technology](../law-and-order/tech-regulation.md) and other contraband. This process generally takes 2-5 years.

Prospective districts with land-locked [Gray Zones](gray-zones.md) inside their borders often find themselves waiting much longer for districting. Once the prospective district is ready, the System Node is switched from testnet to mainnet and the Field Walls are activated.

## **Bridge Districts**

Beginning with the [Morning Light Summit](new-dawn-accords.md#the-morning-light-summit), other states were given the opportunity to sign the [New Dawn Accords](new-dawn-accords.md) and establish districts of their own that adhere to the NDA’s regulations.

Further negotiations with the [African Union](../../african-union/) in the wake of the [Broken Dawn Revolt](../../african-union/history/the-broken-dawn-revolt.md) resulted in a compromise allowing these jurisdictions to optionally implement their own build of [The System](the-system.md) so long as its operation complies with the NDA.

These districts remain a part of their host states while being fully compatible with the operational and legal architecture of GATA. In effect, these districts become bridges between GATA and their host states, making for natural hubs for travel, cultural exchange, enterprise, and commerce.

Within [Bridge Districts](districts.md#bridge-districts), which enforce their own technological [paradigms](paradigms.md), GATA is willing to explore technology sharing initiatives. Even though Bridge Districts are not really part of GATA, it is customary for Bridge Districts to elect governors who serve a diplomatic and symbolic role, liaising with GATA’s [Second Quorum](governance.md#the-second-quorum) and their staff.\

# Yield

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/yield.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Massive static tankers deliver System Yield to a district shipping gate.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

Yield is a periodic distribution of resources and benefits derived from the collective economic and industrial activities across the regions governed by [The System](the-system.md). All economic and industrial activity across [GATA](../) feeds into The System, and Yield is what comes back, calculated according to The Systemâ€™s [hard-coded](../../science-and-tech/hard-code.md) logic.

Yield represents a tangible return on the economic success of GATA and the collective efforts and compliance of [districts](districts.md) that meet the [NDA](new-dawn-accords.md)'s requirements and regulations.

Yield consists of [keys](keys.md), [credits](money.md#credits-currency), and physical goods to be distributed by local governments, and direct airdrops to citizens and [enterprises](../enterprise/).

## **Yield Calculation**

The System uses its comprehensive insight into district activity to calculate each district's Yield. This includes monitoring resource needs, surplus production, economic transactions, crime stats, regulatory compliance, civic participation, and more.

Yield is also modulated based on district performance in key governance metrics. Citizen satisfaction, low crime stats, education stats, and enforcement of the [New Dawn Accords (NDA)](new-dawn-accords.md) are just a few of the contributing factors that are calculated from periodic filings and reports from government, institutions, and [enterprise](../enterprise/).

Unlike the System's raw yield calculations which are hard-coded into every [System Node](the-system.md#system-nodes), these additional modulations are debated and modified regularly in the [Second Quorum](governance.md#the-second-quorum).

Accepting the outcome of these modulations on Yield is a mandatory condition for legal districthood and membership in the Second Quorum. These modulations are incentives for districts to continually develop and align with GATA's broader interests and standards.

### **Yield Economics**

#### **Resource Redistribution:**

* The System reallocates surplus resources from more productive districts to those with deficits, providing a mechanism to balance supply and demand across many metrics.
* Surplus value generated through trade and commerce within GATA and with partner states is redistributed to citizens in the form of [credits](money.md#credits-currency).
* This redistribution helps in stabilizing the economy across GATA, smoothing out regional disparities, and elevating quality of life across [Greater Atla](greater-atla.md), and especially within districts.

#### **Incentive Structures:**

* Districts are incentivized to improve efficiency and governance to increase their Yield.
* Active civic participation is rewarded, fostering a sense of community and responsibility.

#### **Creating Value:**

* By optimizing resource allocation and reducing waste, The System generates additional value.
* Surpluses and efficiencies encourage investment in new technologies and industries, driving economic growth.
* In more mature districts, compounded efficiencies over time reduce the need for active labor, allowing for a focus on innovation and higher-order economic activities, or simple recreation.

#### **Sustainability and Scalability:**

* The System's algorithms adapt to changing economic conditions, ensuring long-term sustainability.
* This model can be scaled up as GATA expands, incorporating new districts and economies into the fold.

# Homesteads

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/7.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Various homesteads dotting the landscape beyond district walls.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

Dotted through the landscape of [Greater Atla](greater-atla.md) are the many homesteads maintained by [GATA](../) citizens who choose to live outside of the security and constraints of a [district](districts.md) or region [on the path toward districthood](districts.md#the-path-to-districthood).

While citizens who live in homesteads are not entitled to [yield](yield.md) from the districts, aid and support are provided by GATA, especially in emergencies.

In some cases, districts will allocate a portion of their yield to nearby homesteads, making sometimes-dangerous shipments of food, medicine and other resources into contested territory where they may encounter [Free Territory](../../free-territories/) militias and criminal piracy often orchestrated by [syndicates](../criminal-element/syndicates.md).

## Luxury Homesteads

While most homesteads are modest residences and communities of citizens who simply prefer to live further afield of the masses, others are merely "homesteads" in name only; isolated oases of luxury and bustling exotic destinations with [enterprise](../enterprise/) services, developed infrastructure, and private defense.

Some of the most wealthy and powerful citizens of GATA live or vacation in remote luxury homesteads, and some even pay astronomical rates to be protected by [Angelis](../military-and-defense/angelis.md) directly.

# The General Record

## **Overview**

The General Record is the official, public record of significant events across [Greater Atla](greater-atla.md).

It is an ever-growing record of historical events as documented by the [First](governance.md#the-first-quorum) and [Second Quorum](governance.md#the-second-quorum). It also includes all public activity on [The System](the-system.md)â€™s decentralized network.

The General Record is a critical source of truth for government and enterprise, as well as legal proceedings. It is often cited by [the AIC](../institutions/atlan-information-control-aic.md) in its deliberations, and in some cases may even be modified by the [AIC's](../institutions/atlan-information-control-aic.md) rulings.

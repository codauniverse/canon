# Collections

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/collections-sfg87.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Collections agents on a static raft confiscating illegal contraband.</p></figcaption></figure>

## **Overview**

One of the enforcement branches of the [AIC](../institutions/atlan-information-control-aic.md), along with [Border Patrol](../borders-and-travel/gate-patrol.md). Collections is a bureau dedicated to the tracking and recovery of illegal technology, and the apprehension of those who exploit it.

Collections conducts long-term investigations, responds to reports from local governments and [local authorities](local-authority.md) across GATA's many [districts](../politics/districts.md), and has personnel stationed at every [Gate](../borders-and-travel/gates.md) and [Spaceport](../borders-and-travel/spaceports.md).

## Collectors

Collections field agents are called Collectors, specially trained investigators and operators who typically work undercover, and are deployed all around the world, from [Greater Atla](../politics/greater-atla.md) and its partner states, to [Gray Zones](../politics/gray-zones.md) and the [Free Territories](../../free-territories/).

Collectors work hand in hand with AIC working groups and local authorities to conduct their investigations into breaches of [NDA](../politics/new-dawn-accords.md) [regulations](tech-regulation.md) and to secure dangerous technologies. Often these investigations implicate gangs, [criminal syndicates](../criminal-element/syndicates.md), and sometimes even expose corruption within enterprise and institutions.

## Collections at District Gates

Every [Gate](../borders-and-travel/gates.md) in GATA has a Collections Desk, an office available to members of the public who wish to report or surrender [illegal technology](tech-regulation.md) or other [Old World](../../history/the-old-world.md) contraband. These Collections Desks also serve as a home base for Collectors who need access to AIC resources and support over the course of their active investigations.

# Children of Atla

## Overview

Orphans and child refugees who fall into the custody of the [Greater Atlan Territorial Alliance (GATA)](../the-basics.md).&#x20;

In the wake of the [Dark Decade](../../history/the-dark-decade.md) and [Reconstruction](../../history/the-reconstruction.md), most children were born into a tumultuous life. As a result, it was not uncommon for children to not know their families, whether they were separated by death or circumstance.

GATA’s policy of universally welcoming orphaned children has meant that, to this day, child refugees are frequently rescued from conflict zones, or turn up at [district](../politics/districts.md) [gates](../borders-and-travel/gates.md).

Sometimes referred to as "GATA’s children", or "flowers", these wards of the state are endowed with [citizenship](../politics/keys.md#citizenship-keys) which entitles them to [System Yield](../politics/yield.md), all basic necessities, as well as care and shelter within one of GATA's [“Gardens”](../institutions/gardens.md); communal housing watched over by System-employed caregivers and local volunteers. Often, these "gardeners" who care for the children were once wards of GATA themselves.

It is common for these orphaned children to be re-located to more stable districts where resources may be more plentiful, or assigned to a district based on special recommendation from the Garden Headmaster.

# Children of Atla

## Overview

Orphans and child refugees who fall into the custody of the Greater Atlan Territorial Alliance (GATA). In the wake of the Dark Decade and Reconstruction, most children were born into a tumultuous context. As a result, it was not uncommon for children to not know their families, whether they were separated by death or circumstance.

GATA’s policy of universally welcoming orphaned children has meant that, to this day, child refugees are frequently rescued from conflict zones, or turn up at district gates.

Sometimes referred to as "GATA’s children", or "flowers", these wards of the state are endowed with citizenship which entitles them to System yield, all basic necessities, as well as care and shelter within one of GATA's “Gardens”; communal housing watched over by System-employed caregivers and local volunteers. Often, these "gardeners" who care for the children were once wards of GATA themselves.

It is common for these children to be re-located to more stable districts where resources may be more plentiful, or based on special recommendation from the Garden Headmaster.

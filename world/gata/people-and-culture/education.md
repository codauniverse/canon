# Education

## Overview

Across [GATA](../the-basics.md), education is held in high regard by older generations, many of whom hope for their children to attend one of the prestigious [Atlan Academies](../institutions/atlan-academies.md), however the standards for acceptance are exceptionally stringent.&#x20;

GATA's Academy system is regarded as the greatest educational wellspring in the world, and with feeder academies in every [district](../politics/districts.md), the Atlan High Academy in GATA’s capitol, [Atla](../key-locations/atla.md), collects the brightest minds from across [Greater Atla](../politics/greater-atla.md) and GATA's [partner states](../politics/new-dawn-accords.md#signatories).

But the Atlan Academies are not the only option for education. All children living in GATA's districts are free to enroll at the [Garden School](../institutions/gardens.md#educational-institutions) until they are 14. There are also a multitude of private schools offering specialized programs and apprenticeships.

But the youth have only known GATA's restrictive regime of control and the limited imaginations of their [paradigms](../politics/paradigms.md). Perhaps as an act of rebellion, or simple pragmatism, many of GATA’s young citizens opt out of education, instead choosing to fend for themselves, perhaps taking on gigs as [operators](../enterprise/operators.md), or working for local [enterprises](../enterprise/) to supplement their [yield](../politics/yield.md).

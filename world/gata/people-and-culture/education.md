# Education

## Overview

Across GATA, education is held in high regard by older generations, but the youth have only known a restrictive regime of control and the limited imaginations of their paradigms. Whether this is a natural or perhaps inevitable trend is a politically contentious issue, but the result has been that many of GATA’s young citizens opt out of education and settle on operator work to supplement their yield.

Despite this, GATA’s Academy system is regarded as the greatest educational wellspring in the world. With feeder academies in every district, the Atlan Academy in GATA’s capitol collects the brightest minds from across [Greater Atla](../politics/greater-atla.md).

# Sports & Games

## Overview

Many traditional sports and games remain popular around the world, from team sports like football and basketball, to track and field, as well as chess and card games. However, a number of newer games have enjoyed massive growth across [GATA](../the-basics.md) and beyond, many of which exploit new technologies to expand the scope of the possible and create new terrain for human competition.

From high-intensity contact sports to gravity-defying races, sports play a significant role in the cultural identities of GATA's various [districts](../politics/districts.md) and other peoples, offering both entertainment and a means of fostering collaboration and friendly competition with other states.

</div>

The most popular spectator sport in GATA. A contact sport played inside of an artificial gravity field. The Defenders defend from the core, a sphere housing the [static field](../../science-and-tech/statics.md) generator that maintains the modified gravitational envelope. The Offense attempts to score points by placing, throwing, or kicking the ball into one of the receptacles on the opposing team's core.

Gravita is known for its complex spatial strategy and hard-hitting action. The Gravita "field" is dotted with small static fixtures that players can use to steady or redirect themselves, obscure the enemy team's line-of-sight, or to bank the ball to teammates.

## **Static GP**

Static GP involves high-speed races through complex tracks using static vehicles of varying size classes. The races take place on courses filled with tight turns, vertical drops, and aerial sections.

Pilots must master the art of static drifting—decoupling one or more of their static nodes and sliding through turns with precision—to maintain speed and control. Vehicles are equipped with advanced static engines for enhanced responsiveness and maneuverability.

Static GP is a high-stakes, prestigious sport with a significant following, known for its breathtaking displays of skill and daring, as well as its high-value prize pools which include [credits](../politics/money.md#credits-currency) and [keys](../politics/keys.md).

</div>

A “dart” is a high-performance variant of the [static boards](../../science-and-tech/statics.md#static-boards) that are popular with the youth, capable of awesome displays of speed and agility. Darts use the widely paradigmed [static field tech](../../science-and-tech/statics.md) to surf the Earth's gravitational field.

Riders use links to drive their dart's static engine, and hone their skills in various dart techniques, based on their style and preferences. One of the most fundamental dart skills that dart riding emphasizes over standard static boards is static drifting; de-coupling one or more of the board's static nodes to fluidly slide through turns and other maneuvers.

Every dart board is tailored to its rider, who must carefully calibrate the static manifold created by their board's [static engine](../../science-and-tech/statics.md#static-engines-and-motion). These compromises determine a dart board's top speed, acceleration and deceleration, maneuverability, range, length, width, and weight.

This diversity of dart board form factors has made it suitable for a wide range of extreme sports, from professional tricking to racing, and rising popularity within street culture where the urban environment presents unique opportunities and challenges.

</div>

Neurochess is a cerebral sport that evolves traditional chess-like play with link use. Players connect to the neurochess board, allowing them to visualize and manipulate the chessboard with their minds. The game can be played on a holographic game board or inside of a virtual construct.&#x20;

The game expands the field of play into a three-dimensional grid, making it far more complex than traditional chess. Strategies are extremely nuanced, and require very strong visual-spatial intelligence.

Neurochess tournaments are major events, drawing large audiences who follow the games through immersive virtual constructs.

## Guarda

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/guarda-53.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>A player considering playing their next card.</p></figcaption></figure>

A card game originating from Atlan refugee camps during the Dark Decade that grew in popularity during GATA's expansion over the course of the Reconstruction.

Guarda can be played with 2-4 players in a free-for-all, or it can be played with up to 8 players in duos, with teammates sitting opposite from each other.

### How to Play

Each player has their own Guarda deck. Every Guarda deck is identical, and contains 36 different Guarda cards representing every possible combination of horizontal and vertical lines on the card/game board's 6x6 grid.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/guardiacard.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>A Guarda card displaying its target spaces and orientation.</p></figcaption></figure>

The cards consist of a central 6x6 grid and a single arrow or other directional indicator. On each card there is one horizontal line in the grid filling up 6 cells horizontally in one of the rows, and there is one vertical line filling up 6 cells vertically in one of the columns. The different combinations of the 6 possible horizontal and vertical lines produce the 36 different possible Guarda cards.

The direction that the arrow is pointing when it is activated determines whether the card is attacking or defending. When a player plays a card with the arrow facing away from themselves, they are attacking. When a player plays a card with the arrow facing toward themselves, they are defending. The cells indicated in the card's grid indicate which spaces are being attacked, or which spaces are being defended.

In the center of the play area is a 6x6 grid. At the beginning of the game, players draw a single card from the top of their shuffled deck and place it face up with the arrow facing toward the board, and where the horizontal and vertical lines on the card's grid intersect is the position on the board that that player's piece will start on. If it is already occupied by another player, they draw until they draw an unoccupied square. After placing their piece, the player places the card(s) they drew in this process face down in their discard pile. Once each player's piece is placed, players each draw a hand of 5 cards.

### Turn Phases

Each turn has 4 phases; (1) Draw, (2) Move, (3) Act, and (4) Prepare.

1. During the draw phase, the player simply draws a card. If they have fewer than 5 cards, the player continues to draw until they hold 5 cards. If a player runs out of cards from their draw pile, they shuffle their discard pile and then draw until they hold 5 cards.
2. During the move phase, a player may move their piece to an adjacent square on the grid if they wish, but they may not move diagonally. The player can choose to discard as many cards as they wish from their hand in order to move an additional space per card, but only in the same direction.
3. During the Act phase, the player may play one and only one card, face up or face down. If they play their card face up, it is immediately activated. This is only done to attack, as there is nothing for the player to defend against. If the player has multiple cards attacking the target space, they can play them all at once to deal one additional damage per card. After a card is spent, it is placed in the discard pile face down.\
   \
   If the player chooses to play their Act phase card face down (which is called a "guard"), it remains face down on the play surface in front of them to be activated at a later time when the player is under attack. Players may only have one guard at any time, and may re-orient their guard as their action if they wish. Players can check their guard card at any time if they have forgotten which way it is oriented.\

4. During the preparation phase, the player may discard as many cards as they wish, but they cannot draw until their next turn, leaving them potentially vulnerable to attack.

### Combat

If a card is played with its arrow pointing toward the central board, the player is attacking any other player whose piece is on one of the indicated cells. If the arrow faces themselves, they are protected from any attacks as long as they are one of the indicated cells.

When attacked, a player may play any card(s) in their hand as a defense if their piece occupies one of the indicated spaces on the card(s) (when the card is oriented with its arrow pointed toward themselves). They cannot counter-attack with cards in their hand.

Alternatively, they may reveal their face-down "guard" card if they wish, but they cannot change the card's directional orientation, meaning they must choose when they originally place the guard if it will be an counter-offensive or defensive card. The card's grid is irrelevant for the guard; all that matters is if it is in the counter-attack or defend orientation.

If the defending player defends with their guard, the attack is unsuccessful, regardless of the number of cards used in the attack. If the defending player counter-attacks with their guard, they only take one point of damage no matter how many cards they attacking player has played attacking them, and the attacking player instead takes damage equal to the number of cards they attacked with.

Unless the player being attacked can defend (or counter-attack with their guard), the attack is successful and the player loses one health point. The defending player cannot defend with cards from their hand and their guard; they must choose which to use against the attack.

The attacking player cannot play their guard to defend against a counter-attack, but they can play cards from their hand to defend themselves if their piece occupies one of the indicated spaces on the card(s).

### Winning the Game

Guarda can be played with a variety of win conditions.

#### Elimination

The most common style of play. In standard play each player begins the game with 6 health points. Players take turns until there is only one player, or team, left standing.

#### Victory

In standard play each successful attack on an opponent earns the attacking player, or team, a point. First player or team to 6 points wins.

#### Exhaustion

When a player runs out of cards in their draw pile they are defeated.

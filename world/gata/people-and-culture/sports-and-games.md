# Sports & Games

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/sports-733.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Children playing soccer in a field in the outskirts of a recovering city.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

Many traditional sports and games remain popular around the world, from team sports like football and basketball, to track and field, as well as chess and card games. However, a number of newer games have enjoyed massive growth across [GATA](../the-basics.md) and beyond, many of which exploit new technologies to expand the scope of the possible and create new terrain for human competition.

From high-intensity contact sports to gravity-defying races, sports play a significant role in the cultural identities of GATA's various [districts](../politics/districts.md) and other peoples, offering both entertainment and a means of fostering collaboration and friendly competition with other states.

</div>

The most popular spectator sport in GATA. A contact sport played inside of an artificial gravity field. The Defenders defend from the core, a sphere housing the [static field](../../science-and-tech/statics.md) generator that maintains the modified gravitational envelope. The Offense attempts to score points by placing, throwing, or kicking the ball into one of the receptacles on the opposing team's core.

Gravita is known for its complex spatial strategy and hard-hitting action. The Gravita "field" is dotted with small static fixtures that players can use to steady or redirect themselves, obscure the enemy team's line-of-sight, or to bank the ball to teammates.

## **Static GP**

Static GP involves high-speed races through complex tracks using static vehicles of varying size classes. The races take place on courses filled with tight turns, vertical drops, and aerial sections.

Pilots must master the art of static drifting—decoupling one or more of their static nodes and sliding through turns with precision—to maintain speed and control. Vehicles are equipped with advanced static engines for enhanced responsiveness and maneuverability.

Static GP is a high-stakes, prestigious sport with a significant following, known for its breathtaking displays of skill and daring, as well as its high-value prize pools which include [credits](../politics/money.md#credits-currency) and [keys](../politics/keys.md).

## **Darts**

</div>

A “dart” is a high-performance variant of the [static boards](../../science-and-tech/statics.md#static-boards) that are popular with the youth, capable of awesome displays of speed and agility. Darts use the widely paradigmed [static field tech](../../science-and-tech/statics.md) to surf the Earth's gravitational field.

Riders use links to drive their dart's static engine, and hone their skills in various dart techniques, based on their style and preferences. One of the most fundamental dart skills that dart riding emphasizes over standard static boards is static drifting; de-coupling one or more of the board's static nodes to fluidly slide through turns and other maneuvers.

Every dart board is tailored to its rider, who must carefully calibrate the static manifold created by their board's [static engine](../../science-and-tech/statics.md#static-engines-and-motion). These compromises determine a dart board's top speed, acceleration and deceleration, maneuverability, range, length, width, and weight.

This diversity of dart board form factors has made it suitable for a wide range of extreme sports, from professional tricking to racing, and rising popularity within street culture where the urban environment presents unique opportunities and challenges.

</div>

Neurochess is a cerebral sport that evolves traditional chess-like play with [link use](../../science-and-tech/links.md). Players connect to the neurochess board, allowing them to visualize and manipulate the chessboard with their minds. The game can be played on a holographic game board or inside of a [virtual construct](../../science-and-tech/constructs.md#virtual-constructs).&#x20;

The game adapts signature chess mechanics and expands the field of play into a three-dimensional cube grid, making it far more complex than traditional chess. Strategies are extremely nuanced, and require very strong visual-spatial intelligence. Naturally, [psychotech](../../science-and-tech/psychotech.md) is not permitted during play.

Neurochess tournaments are major events within academic and upper-class circles, drawing large audiences who follow the games through immersive virtual constructs. Neurochess is easily the most competitive and prestigious game or sport across all of the [Atlan Academies](../institutions/the-atlan-academy-system.md), and success in neurochess is a sure path to recognition within and without the academy's higher ranks.

## Guarda

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/guarda-53.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>A player considering playing their next card.</p></figcaption></figure>

A tactical card game originating during [the Dark Decade](../../history/the-dark-decade.md) that grew in popularity during [GATA's](../the-basics.md) expansion over the course of [the Reconstruction](../../history/the-reconstruction.md).&#x20;

The cards used in Guarda predate the game by several years. The cards were originally called "léi" (雷, pronounced "lei", meaning "thunder"), and were created by a Chinese-American software engineer in [Bright Mesa](../history/bright-mesa.md), two years after [the Crash](../../history/the-crash.md). Inspired by the I Ching, the cards enjoyed some early popularity in the American South West as a divination system during the Dark Decade. Léi divination remains popular to this day, particularly in [the Free Territories](../../free-territories/the-basics.md) of North America and China.

It is not known who first started using the lei cards as a game, but before long, the children of Bright Mesa were drawing grids in the dirt and using the cards to attack and defend. By the end of the Dark Decade the rules had been refined, and it had become wildly popular, even among the adults who had come to enjoy gambling on the game.

After [the Morning Light Summit](../politics/new-dawn-accords.md#the-morning-light-summit) and the nearby LA camp's subsequent [districting](../politics/districts.md#the-path-to-districthood) by the fledging GATA, people began to, slowly, and then suddenly, travel great distances once again. The mass, voluntary relocation of a huge number of refugees under [Atla's](../key-locations/atla.md) [Existence Doctrine](../military-and-defense/existence-doctrine.md) spread the game far and wide at the very onset of the Reconstruction.

"Guarda" as it was then called, (a Spanish-language reference to Atla's symbolic [Guardian](../military-and-defense/guardians.md) [war frames](../../science-and-tech/frames.md)), quickly became the most popular new table game since the rise of poker in the 20th century.

### The Basics

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/guarda-777.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Guarda with its 6x6 grid.</p></figcaption></figure>

Guarda is a strategic card game that can be played with 2-8 players in free-for-all or teams.

In the center of the play area is a 6x6 grid. Players each sit facing one side of the grid. Each player has a singular game piece which they will move around this grid throughout the game.

On every Guarda card is the same 6x6 grid, as well as a single arrow or other directional indicator. The card's grid either displays a horizontal line filling up 6 consecutive horizontal grid cells in one of the rows, or a vertical line filling up 6 consecutive vertical grid cells in one of the columns.

Players take turns clockwise, drawing cards, moving, and playing their cards (attacking and defending) until a winner is decided.

### The Cards

Each player has their own Guarda deck. Though different decks may have different visual designs, the decks are identical in terms of their composition.

Every Guarda deck contains three copies of each of the 12 different Guarda cards.

Half of the cards depict the six complete vertical lines that can be drawn on the game's 6x6 grid. The other half depict the six complete horizontal lines that can be drawn on the game's 6x6 grid.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/guardiacard.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The Guarda card grid and orientation indicator.</p></figcaption></figure>

The direction that a card's arrow is pointing (towards the grid or towards the player) when it is played determines whether the card is attacking or defending.&#x20;

When a player plays a card with the arrow pointing towards the grid, they are attacking. When a player plays a card with the arrow pointing toward themselves, they are defending. The grid cells that are highlighted on the card indicate which spaces are being attacked or defended.

### Getting Started

Before the game begins, a player is selected to draw first. Each player then takes clockwise turns drawing a single card from the top of their shuffled deck and placing it face up in front of themselves with the arrow pointing toward the grid.

Once a player has drawn two cards with overlapping spaces, they then place their game piece on a space in the grid where the horizontal and vertical lines on their cards' grid patterns intersect. If that space is already occupied by another player, they draw until they draw an unoccupied intersecting space.&#x20;

After placing their piece, the player places any cards drawn in this process face down in their discard pile. Once every player's piece is placed, players each draw a hand of 5 cards.

### Turn Phases

Each turn has 4 short phases; (1) Draw, (2) Move, (3) Act, and (4) Settle.

1. During the Draw phase, the player draws a card. If they have more than 5 cards in their hand they must discard until they have only 5 cards. If they have fewer than 5 cards, the player continues to draw until they hold 5 cards. If the player runs out of cards from their draw pile, they shuffle their discard pile and then draw until they hold 5 cards.
2. During the Move phase, the player may move their piece to an adjacent square on the grid if they wish, but they may not move diagonally. The player can choose to discard as many cards as they wish from their hand in order to move an additional space for each discarded card, but they may only move in one direction.
3. During the Act phase, the player may play a card face up or face down.\
   \
   If a player plays their card face up, this is an attack. Attacking cards are played offensively with the arrow pointing toward the grid. The attacking player must announce an occupied space as their target, and may use multiple cards to attack the same target, dealing one damage for each attacking card, as long as the grid pattern on the attacking card(s) overlap the target space.\
   \
   The attacks will deal damage to any and all opponents on spaces overlapped by the attacking card(s) grid pattern. Players on affected spaces may then react by blocking, counter-attacking, or activating their guard, if they are able.\
   \
   If the player chooses to play their card face down, this is called setting their "guard". It remains face down on the play surface in front of them, to be activated at a later time when the player is under attack.\
   \
   Players may only have one guard at any time, and may re-orient their guard as their sole action during their turn if they wish. Players can check their guard card at any time if they have forgotten which way it is oriented.\

4. During the Settle phase, the player discards any cards played face down during their turn, and may discard as many additional cards as they wish (Note: discarded cards during the Settle phase do not grant movement). The player will draw replacement cards at the beginning of their next turn.

### Combat

If a card is played with its arrow pointing toward the grid, the player is attacking any other player whose piece is on one of the indicated spaces. If the arrow points toward its owner, they are defending against attacks on the indicated spaces.

#### React Phase

If an attack is made, the React phase begins and any player(s) being attacked may choose to react by Blocking, Counter-Attacking, or activating their guard.

During the React phase, any defending player(s) may play any card(s) in their hand as a defense, so long as the card's grid pattern overlaps with the defending player's piece on the grid when played defensively (with the arrow facing themselves). They cannot counter-attack with cards in their hand.

Alternatively, they may reveal and activate their face-down "guard", but they cannot change the card's orientation at the same time. The card's grid is irrelevant for the guard; all that matters is if it is in an offensive or defensive orientation.

If the defending player's activated guard defends, the attack is unsuccessful, regardless of the number of cards used in the attack.

If the defending player's activated guard counter-attacks, the defending player only takes one point of damage no matter how many cards the attacking player has played attacking them, and the attacking player instead takes that damage.

If the defending player activated their guard, it is discarded afterwards.

Unless the player being attacked can defend or counter-attack, the attack is successful and the player loses one health point for each attacking card. The player cannot defend against the same attack with cards from their hand and their guard; they must choose which to use against the attack, even if the attack is made with multiple cards.

The attacking player cannot play their guard to defend against the defending player's counter-attack, but they can play cards from their hand to defend against a counter-attack.

If no more actions are to be taken, and the attacking player remains in the game, the React phase concludes, and the attacking player's turn continues to its Settle phase.

### Winning the Game

Guarda can be played with a variety of win conditions, and is sometimes played with stakes.

#### Standard (No Stakes):

* **Elimination:** The most common style of play. Each player begins the game with 10 health points. Players take turns until there is only one player, or team, left standing.
* **Victory:** Each successful attack on an opponent earns the attacking player, or team, a point. First player or team to 10 points wins.
* **Exhaustion:** Players do not reshuffle their discard pile when they exhaust their draw pile. When a player runs out of cards in their draw pile, they are defeated.

#### Gambling (Stakes):

* **Bounty:** The same as Elimination, except each player must ante up with the table stake (called their "bounty"). When a player defeats an opponent, they claim that player's bounty.
* **Spoils of War:** The same as Victory, except each player must ante up with the table stake (called their "spoils"). The winning player or team takes all.
* **Scavenger:** The same as Exhaustion, except each player must ante up with the table stake (called their "loot"). When a player is defeated, their piece remains on the grid, and the first player to move to the same space claims their loot.

Notes:

* It is common for the back side of standard Guarda cards to depict a 2x3 grid of square cells, so that six spare cards can be laid to produce a 6x6 grid for play area. This also allows players to design irregular grids for their games, if they choose.
* In addition to the gambling variants of Guarda, there are a number of regional variants and meta-games that use Guarda cards as their foundation. However, none are nearly as popular as classic Guarda.

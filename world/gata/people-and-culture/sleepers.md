# Sleepers

## **Overview**

Sleepers are individuals who, for various reasons, spend the majority or entirety of their life within virtual constructs. While some are bedridden with various conditions, there are those who prefer life in the constructs, and others who work on or even within constructs.

Sleepers are rarely seen but their presence is nonetheless felt in subtle ways across GATA, from their influence in politics and enterprise, to the ubiquitous dormitories that house many.

## Dormitories

Dormitories serve as purpose-built residences for individuals who spend most of their lives in virtual constructs, either due to medical conditions, personal preference, or occupational requirements.

They can range widely by purpose, from rows of short-term "dive pods" found at inns, resorts and arcades, to long-term facilities with full-time care staff and automata. These more dedicated dormitories often include common areas where sleepers can move about and interact in real-life when necessary. These spaces are designed to be quiet and soothing, with amenities that promote mental health and well-being.

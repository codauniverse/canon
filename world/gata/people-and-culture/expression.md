## **Music**

Musical trends and tastes are diverse and plentiful across Greater Atla, reflecting the kaleidoscope of people and cultures enfolded within GATA.

A thriving tradition of folk music persists, tracing from the Old World, into its prominence during the Dark Decade. At the same time, numerous innovations in hard-coded audio synthesis, as well as resonance-based technologies have opened up new frontiers for contemporary musical artists.

The creation and consumption of music has also been heavily influenced by the introduction of links in districts where they are legal.

The unique affordances of modern music technology are on full display in many of GATA's great concert halls and amphitheaters, where sights and sounds are enhanced with precisely calibrated multi-sensory stimulation, including low and high frequency resonance used to influence the listeners state of mind, from altering their mood to reducing inhibitions.

These techniques are taken to their extreme in the underground music scene at sync raves where sync jockeys project their mind to an entire crowd with the use of links and an illegally modified sync hub.

## **Senseart**

Link-based art and entertainment. Senseart refers to media, objects and installations imbued with hard-coded carriers for impressions and sensations. The structure of the senseart causes very slight physical modulations of the electrical field connecting the link and the object of attention, allowing a focused mind's brainwaves to be entrained in an engineered fashion.

The effects of senseart are very subtle for those who are not experienced with surrendering to the entrainment effect of the senseart.

Well crafted senseart can convey more than simple impressions, with some constructed to confer deeper understanding to those who study it deeply with the use of their link.

Senseart is generally not produced using LMNL, instead often opting for hand-compiled custom hard-code.&#x20;

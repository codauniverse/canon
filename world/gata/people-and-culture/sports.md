# Sports

### **Gravita**

The most popular spectator sport in GATA. A contact sport played inside of an artificial gravity field. The Defenders defend from the core, a sphere housing the static field generator that maintains the modified gravitational envelope. The Offense attempts to score points by placing, throwing, or kicking the ball into one of the receptacles on the core’s poles.

Gravita is known for its complex spatial strategy and hard-hitting action. The Gravita "field" is dotted with small static fixtures that players can use to steady or redirect themselves, or to bank the ball to teammates.

### **Darts**

Dart boards are sports equipment based on fairly widely paradigmed static field tech and powered by small Weaver reactors. A “dart” is a personal conveyance device in a form-factor similar to a surf board, somewhat resembling a thrown dart, that is used to convey its pilot with extreme speed and agility.

Dart boards must compromise between the static manifold surface area for generating thrust, dividing manifold surface area between the different flight surfaces. These interrelated compromises determine a dart board's top speed, acceleration and deceleration, maneuverability, and size.

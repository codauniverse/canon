# Sports

## Overview

Many traditional sports and games remain popular around the world, from team sports like football and basketball, to track and field, as well as chess and card games. However, a number of newer games have enjoyed massive growth across GATA and beyond, many of which exploit new technologies to expand the scope of the possible and create new terrain for human competition.

From high-intensity contact sports to gravity-defying races, sports play a significant role in the cultural identities of GATA's various districts and other peoples, offering both entertainment and a means of fostering collaboration and friendly competition with other states.

### **Gravita**

The most popular spectator sport in GATA. A contact sport played inside of an artificial gravity field. The Defenders defend from the core, a sphere housing the static field generator that maintains the modified gravitational envelope. The Offense attempts to score points by placing, throwing, or kicking the ball into one of the receptacles on the core’s poles.

Gravita is known for its complex spatial strategy and hard-hitting action. The Gravita "field" is dotted with small static fixtures that players can use to steady or redirect themselves, or to bank the ball to teammates.

### **Static GP**

Static GP involves high-speed races through complex tracks using static vehicles of varying size classes. The races take place on courses filled with tight turns, vertical drops, and aerial sections. Pilots must master the art of static drifting—decoupling their static nodes and sliding through turns with precision—to maintain speed and control. Vehicles are equipped with advanced static engines for enhanced maneuverability. Static GP is a high-stakes, prestigious sport with a significant following, known for its breathtaking displays of skill and daring.

### **Darts**

Dart boards are sports equipment based on widely paradigmed static field tech and powered by small, efficient batteries. A “dart” is a personal conveyance device in a form-factor similar to a surf board, somewhat resembling a thrown dart, that is used to convey its pilot with extreme speed and agility.

Dart boards must compromise between the static manifold surface area for generating thrust, dividing manifold surface area between the different flight surfaces. These interrelated compromises determine a dart board's top speed, acceleration and deceleration, maneuverability, range, and size.

This diversity of dart board form factors has made it suitable for a wide range of sport and recreation applications, from professional tricking to racing, and rising popularity within street culture where the urban environment presents unique opportunities and challenges.

### Neurochess

Neurochess is a cerebral sport that evolves traditional chess-like play with link use. Players connect to the neurochess board, allowing them to visualize and manipulate the chessboard with their minds. The game expands the field of play into a three-dimensional grid, making it far more complex than traditional chess. Strategies are extremely complex, and require very strong visual-spatial intelligence. Neurochess tournaments are major events, drawing large audiences who follow the games through immersive virtual constructs.

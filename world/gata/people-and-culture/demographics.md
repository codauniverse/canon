# Demographics

## Overview

The Greater Atlantic Territorial Alliance (GATA) is a vast super-state spanning the East half of North America, California, the Northern coast of South America, the Northern Coast of Africa, and Western Europe. This expansive territory, coupled with historical mass migrations and a dynamic socio-political configuration, has resulted in a highly diverse and intermingled population.

## Population Distribution and Density

### Urban Centers

Major population centers include districts such as Atla (the oceanic capital), New York, Greater Toronto, Montreal, Paris, London, São Paulo, and Cairo. These urban hubs are characterized by high population densities, GATA's advanced infrastructure, and significant economic activity.

### Migration Patterns

The Dark Decade (2052-2060s) saw massive migrations towards areas with abundant fresh water, notably the Great Lakes and major river systems. This has led to increased population densities in these regions, with many new settlements and urban expansions.

### Rural and Peripheral Areas

GATA’s rural areas, particularly in the northern regions and the top half of Brazil, have lower population densities but are critical for agriculture and resource extraction.

***

## Age Distribution

Generally speaking, GATA, like the rest of the world, has a youthful demographic. The global median age is 21 years, with over 65% of the population under 30 years old. This skew towards a younger population is a direct result of costly regional military conflicts, limited availability of high-quality medical resources during the early Reconstruction era, and the lasting impacts of the Dark Decade.

## Ethnic and Cultural Diversity

### Ethnic Intermingling

The displacement of populations over the past century has resulted in a highly intermixed society. Traditional ethnic boundaries have blurred, leading to a multicultural and multiethnic populace, particularly in major urban centers and districts.

### Cultural Fusion

The fusion of cultures is evident in various aspects of daily life, from cuisine to festivals, language, and fashion. This cultural amalgamation has become a defining characteristic of GATA's social fabric. Look no further than the increasingly popular evangelical Church of the Sky, or the overflowing Gardens where orphans and refugee children cohabitate as Children of Atla.

## Socioeconomic Distribution

### Prosperous Districts

Districts like Atla, Greater Toronto, and Paris are characterized by high standards of living, advanced technological infrastructure, and diverse, skilled populations. These areas have benefited significantly from the influx of skilled labor and the strategic relocation of orphans and professionals during the Reconstruction.

### Developing Areas

While many districts are prosperous, progress is not made evenly, and some peripheral regions still face significant challenges related to infrastructure development and economic disparity. Efforts are ongoing to integrate these areas more fully into GATA's economic system, however tensions with Sovereigns and small rebel states frustrate these initiatives.

## Migration and Relocation

### Skilled Labor Migration

During the Reconstruction, GATA actively relocated skilled labor to key districts, resulting in highly specialized populations in cities like Atla and Greater Toronto. This has led to pockets of advanced technological and industrial capabilities concentrated in these regions, codified into their district paradigms.

### Orphan Relocation Programs

The relocation of orphans to various districts during the Reconstruction has created a generation of young, adaptable citizens with an identity defined by a shared lack of ethno-cultural and national roots. This has been particularly influential in fostering a unique sort of cohesion in GATA's citizenry, despite the undeniable reality of significant political and social disagreements across its territories.

## Key Demographic Statistics

**Total Population:** Estimated at around 2,329,000,000.

**Urbanization Rate:** Approximately 50% of the population resides in districts, and a further 23% live in undistricted urban centers.

**Literacy Rate:** Nearly 100% within districts, due to strong and universally accessible educational systems, and widespread access to information via System terminals.

**Life Expectancy:** Average life expectancy is 85 years, thanks to GATA's advanced healthcare and quality of life, however in recent years, this estimate has begun to increase dramatically as a result of AKICEL's therapies and innovative interventions.

## Challenges and Future Trends

### Aging Infrastructure

Some regions still contend with aging infrastructure lingering from the Old World era, necessitating ongoing reconstruction and modernization efforts.

### Environmental Sustainability

With large territorial concerns in the Arctic and Amazon regions, GATA faces significant environmental sustainability challenges, particularly in managing resources and addressing climate change impacts and the fallout from Northern Asia's ever-present environmental crisis resulting from nuclear fallout during the first days of the Dark Decade.

### Technological Integration

Continuous technological advancements require effective integration across diverse districts while maintaining the AIC's strictly tailored paradigms, ensuring equitable access and minimizing the digital divide while mitigating the risks posed by unchecked technological development.

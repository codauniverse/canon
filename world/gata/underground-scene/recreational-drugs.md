# Recreational Drugs

## Common Street Drugs

### **Touch**

The popular designer street drug, an extremely powerful empathogen designed for [syncing](../../science-and-tech/sync-hubs.md#syncing). Significantly enhances the effect. Overdose, though rare due to the relative cost of the dose required, can cause seizures. If the overdosing individual is [pushing](../../science-and-tech/links.md#pushing), this can trigger secondary seizures and distress in others. Is taken orally. Based on the [Angelis](../military-and-defense/angelis.md)-developed interrogator-enhancing drug [Exproxin](recreational-drugs.md#exproxin).

### Exproxin

The drug from which [Touch](recreational-drugs.md#touch) and [Mentle](recreational-drugs.md#mentle) are derived.

***

### **Mentle**

A drug temporarily simulating extreme autism. Users can perform extremely complex calculations and transformations in their mind and operate demanding, multivariate systems. While under the effects of mentle, calculation and ordering can become extremely pleasurable activities.

Authentic [GATA](../)-made [Exproxin](recreational-drugs.md#exproxin) is calibrated to the user to deliver a 6 hour effect that can be rapidly neutralized by consuming carbohydrates. Street mentle can vary widely in potency. An excessive dose combined with in can cause permanent brain damage or death.

***

### **Time Dilators**

Used in the military for high-intensity, often life-threatening short-term tasks. [Conduit](../../science-and-tech/links.md#conduits) fighter pilots and [Angelis](../military-and-defense/angelis.md) [Watchers](../military-and-defense/angelis.md#watchers) are required to use mild dilators to be able to monitor their complex HUDs in real-time.

Produced exclusively in the struggling [URSA](../../ursa/). At present, a dilator shortage has strained normally cooperative relations between Angelis and [Aryabat](../../aryabat/) [enterprises](../../aryabat/enterprise/), as both require the limited supply. Meanwhile, black market producers are enjoying the drug’s new luxury status. Time dilators are insufflated or inhaled.

***

### **Dozer**

A depressant at smaller doses, and a sleeping aid at higher ones. When properly dosed for recreational purposes it induces a sleep-walking state where the user hallucinates and is highly suggestible. Experienced users can stay conscious in this in-between state, called ‘riding the line’.

***

### **Benders**

Slang for synthetic psychoactives, typically consumed in liquid or vapor form. High end designer benders are specially tailored for the individual and the desired effect. Good benders have well designed timed-release gradients to ensure gentle comedowns.

Abusing low-quality street benders can cause “baby brain”, excess neurogenesis and cellular genesis causing permanent loss of memory, personality and capability in varying degrees.

***

### **Max**

An ingestible, illegal nano drug (‘a nano’) that temporarily turns some of the host’s cells into factories’ for raw materials that it uses to create temporary nano-structures that enhance the mechanical work of biological bone, muscle and tendons, allowing the human body to generate and sustain increased performance and resilience for a few hours.

Max is illegal because it’s so easy to overdose and the short and long-term side effects are quite severe, including extreme fatigue, dehydration, discomfort, soreness, itchiness, nerve damage, heart damage, and sudden death.

If you don’t have an older nano immune system, it can be deadly to use Max.

***

### Crimson

Derived from the highly-difficult to cultivate [Red variant](../../science-and-tech/the-manna-flower.md#red) of the [Manna Flower](../../science-and-tech/the-manna-flower.md).

***

### **Naze**

A small device used to deliver drugs into the nostril. A naze can produce nearly any drug molecule, however the [Asimovian](../../science-and-tech/asimovian-architecture.md) filter prevents the synthesis of banned substances. But it is common for the youth and those on the margins to bypass the filter with cartridge mods.

Some keep a naze in their pocket, others around their neck, and for some it never leaves their face.

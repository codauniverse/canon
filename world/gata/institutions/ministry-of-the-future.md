# Ministry of the Future

## Overview

The Ministry of the Future is an advisory council and research fund dedicated to identifying major technological, economic, and geopolitical risks and opportunities for GATA's institutions and enterprise.

The Ministry of the Future focuses primarily on identifying deep trends, novel research with unforeseen potential, and systemic risks across all domains.

Ministry reports often focus on 10, 20, 50, and 100 year time horizons, and balance philosophical vision with clear-eyed probabilistic planning and preparedness.&#x20;

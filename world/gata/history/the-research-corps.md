# The Research Corps

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/helios-1.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A Research Corps field team attending to an emergency.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

One of the key assets for [Atla’s](../key-locations/atla.md) early development was its Research Corps, the primary locus of civic engagement for its founding citizenry of thinkers, scientists and skilled workers. Atlans were encouraged to explore theoretical and applied research topics deemed to be in the interest of human survival, civilizational recovery, and threat mitigation.

To this day, the Research Corps remains one of the driving forces in humanity's exploration of the Universe's ever-deepening mysteries. While it began as an Atlan initiative, and became a key resource for the [Greater Atlan Territorial Alliance](../the-basics.md) during the early [Reconstruction](../../history/the-reconstruction.md), the Research Corps is now one of the formative institutions of the young space nation, [Sol](../../sol/).

## Historical Impact

Many of the Research Corps’ early projects fed into [Existence Doctrine](../military-and-defense/existence-doctrine.md) programs during the end of the Dark Decade and throughout most of The Reconstruction. Some technologies that resulted from Research Corps work include [LMNL](../../science-and-tech/hard-code.md#lmnl), [links](../../science-and-tech/links.md), [AKICEL therapy](../health-and-medicine/akicel.md), and [The System](../politics/the-system.md). Some public institutions born from these programs persist to this day, such as [Systema](../enterprise/systema.md) and the Ministry of the Future.

## The Research Corps and Sol

When GATA founded Sol, the Research Corps was split off from GATA to form one of the core institutions of the new nation, ensuring a foundational alignment between the two nations. During this split, many administrators and researchers within the Research Corps were retained by GATA and transferred to [ALTAR](../institutions/altar.md). To this day, the Research Corps remains one of ALTAR’s closest partners, and one of the few organizations with personnel stationed in ALTAR’s deep-sea complex.

## Working for the Research Corps

While many of the Research Corps’ researchers investigate the mysteries of science from the relative safety of the lab, others are deployed into the field to seek and study new discoveries, assist with disaster response, and shadow other researchers and specialists.

Working for Sol’s Research Corps remains one of the most prestigious occupations that young citizens of Sol and GATA can aspire to. With experience in the Research Corps comes [exclusive access keys](../politics/keys.md) that make its current and former membership particularly valuable to [enterprise](../enterprise/). This offers industrious young minds a straightforward path to high yields, special perks, and gate keys to other [districts](../politics/districts.md).

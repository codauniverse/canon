## Overview

Spaceports in the Greater Atlan Territorial Alliance (GATA) are increasingly active hubs for space-bound travel to orbit, the moon, and beyond. They are known for their stringent security protocols and state-of-the art logistical systems.

Spaceports play a key role in bolstering the growing off-world enterprises of GATA, Sol, and other nations, enabling both civilian and enterprise travel while maintaining strict security protocols that support GATA’s territorial integrity.

## Security and Staff

Each spaceport in GATA has dedicated Collections desk staff and Gate Patrol agents on site. The staff is responsible for securing the spaceport and scanning luggage, cargo, as well as passengers. Spaceports also typically leverage the labor of automata to streamline loading and maintenance.

Travelers must possess the appropriate keys for travel, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the spaceports.

Spaceports utilize static-powered boarding and loading gondolas to ferry cargo, passengers, and crew if necessary, providing smooth and reliable transportation within the spaceport premises.

## Types of Spaceports

#### Civilian Spaceports

Serve the general public and various enterprises. Located within GATA’s district interiors and Greater Atla. Facilitate travel and transport across different districts and territories.

#### Military Spaceports

Operated by Angelis, GATA's military enterprise, ensuring the security of territorial interests. Used for strategic operations and deployment of military personnel and equipment.

#### Sovereign Spaceports

Located in the Free Territories and operated by Sovereign groups, with distinct, and often lax, regulatory and operational frameworks compared to GATA's spaceports.

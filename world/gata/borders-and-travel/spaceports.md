## Overview

Spaceports in the [Greater Atlan Territorial Alliance (GATA)](../the-basics.md) are increasingly active hubs for space-bound travel to orbit, the moon, and beyond. Similar to district [Gates](gates.md), they are known for their stringent, [NDA-compliant](../politics/new-dawn-accords.md) security protocols and state-of-the art logistical systems.

Spaceports play a key role in bolstering the growing off-world [enterprises](../enterprise/) of GATA, [Sol](../../sol/the-basics.md), and other nations, enabling both civilian and enterprise travel while adhering to the strict security measures that are critical to preserving GATA’s territorial integrity.

## Security and Staff

Each spaceport in GATA has dedicated [Collections](../law-and-order/collections.md) desk staff and [Gate Patrol](gate-patrol.md) agents on site. The staff is responsible for securing the spaceport and [scanning](../../science-and-tech/scanners.md) luggage, cargo, as well as passengers. Spaceports also typically leverage the labor of [automata](../../science-and-tech/automata.md) to streamline loading and maintenance.

In GATA, travelers must possess the [appropriate keys](../politics/keys.md) for travel, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the spaceports.

Spaceports utilize [static-powered](../../science-and-tech/statics.md) boarding and loading [gondolas](../../science-and-tech/statics.md#gondolas) to ferry cargo, passengers, and crew if necessary, providing smooth and reliable transportation within the spaceport premises.

## Types of Spaceports

#### Civilian Spaceports

Serve the general public and various enterprises. Located within GATA’s [district](../politics/districts.md) interiors and scattered throughout [Greater Atla](../politics/greater-atla.md). Facilitate travel and transport across different districts and territories.

#### Military Spaceports

Operated by [Angelis](../military-and-defense/angelis.md), GATA's military enterprise, ensuring the security of territorial interests. Used for strategic operations and deployment of military personnel and equipment.

#### Sovereign Spaceports

Located in [the Free Territories](../../free-territories/the-basics.md) and operated by [Sovereign](../../free-territories/people-and-culture/sovereigns.md) groups, with distinct, and often lax, regulatory and operational frameworks compared to GATA's spaceports.

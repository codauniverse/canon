# Field Walls

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/fieldwalls.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A district's field wall stretching into the distance.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

The district boundaries are marked by contiguous walls of ghostly light that stretch into the sky. GATA-built emitters are placed at regular distances and can detect any object passing through the walls. Gate Patrol will arrive shortly thereafter, and with their military-grade handheld "mappers" they can detect and track just about anything.

Refugees and smugglers are taken into custody, while incidents involving district citizens are typically left to a district's local government to address. If a district fails to enforce their border security effectively, their yield may decrease or their paradigmâ€™s development may be deprioritized.

# Gates

## Overview

Gates are the border crossings that control the flow of people and goods in and out of [GATA's](../the-basics.md) [districts](../politics/districts.md). In order to cross through a gate, a traveler or shipment must be authorized with the appropriate [keys](../politics/keys.md). Gates themselves have fairly minimal security forces on-site, however [Gate Patrol](gate-patrol.md) is garrisoned nearby outside of the district's [field wall](field-walls.md), and gates are also actively monitored from space by [Angelis](../military-and-defense/angelis.md).

All goods and people passing into or between districts in GATA must cross through a Gate. Security at the gates (and all GATA borders) is overseen a dedicated [Collections](../law-and-order/collections.md) desk and supported by a small Gate Patrol unit located on-site.

Gate staff includes attendants who assist travelers with their processing, Collectors who inspect and [scan](../../science-and-tech/scanners.md) cargo and luggage transiting the gate, and gateworker [conduits](../../science-and-tech/links.md#conduits) who move cargo with [frames](../../science-and-tech/frames.md) and [grabbers](../../science-and-tech/grabbers.md). Gate security is supported by basic [cogs](../../science-and-tech/cogs.md) that scrutinize gate traffic and traveler metadata.

## Gate Keys

Citizens of GATA are not permitted to enter a district without the requisite [keys](../politics/keys.md). An individual can possess district keys themselves, or they can lease keys on the market.

When travel is required for legitimate reasons, citizens can be assigned temporary keys (sometimes called travel keys) that can be escort-class (requires a sponsor chaperone) or solo (free to travel alone).

Citizens possess keys to their home district, but some citizens of GATA don’t have home districts, or have been lawfully [exiled](../law-and-order/exile.md), and so are not permitted entry into any districts.

Gate Keys don’t only grant citizens access to a district, but also allow them to collect their share of the [Yield ](../politics/yield.md)in the form of [credits](../politics/money.md#credits-currency) and [System](../politics/the-system.md) amenities such as housing, and medical care.

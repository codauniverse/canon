# Gates

## Overview

Gates are the border crossings that control the flow of people and goods in and out of districts. Gates themselves have fairly minimal security presence on-site, however Gate Patrol is garrisoned nearby outside of the district's field wall, and gates are also actively monitored from space by Angelis Rapid Response.

All goods and people passing into or between districts in GATA must cross through a Gate. Security at the gates (and all GATA borders) is overseen by Gate Patrol in cooperation with Angelis, however most gate workers are conduits who move and organize shipments, supported by basic cogs that inspect cargo and scrutinize gate traffic.

## Gate Keys

Citizens of GATA are not permitted to enter a district without the requisite keys. An individual can possess district keys themselves, or they can lease keys on the market.

When travel is required for appropriate reasons, citizens can be assigned temporary keys (sometimes called travel keys) that can be escort (requires a given chaperone) or solo (free to travel alone).

Citizens possess keys to their home district, but some citizens of GATA don’t have home districts, or have been lawfully exiled, and so are not permitted entry into any districts.

Gate Keys don’t only grant citizens access to a district, but also allow them to collect their share of the Yield in the form of credits, System amenities such as housing, and medical care.

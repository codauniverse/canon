# Gate Patrol

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/gatepatrol-536.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Gate Patrol operators retrieving smuggled goods in Greater Atla.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

Gate Patrol consists of various personnel, including inspectors, intelligence operatives, embedded Angelis officers, specially trained border guards, and support combat units.

Gate Patrol are meant to utilize non-lethal means against suspects, however they are equipped for armed resistance and deaths do occur. Gate Patrol agents typically utilize non-lethal jelly rounds to immobilize targets.

They are typically found patrolling the perimeter of GATA's districts, stationed at outposts, or deployed deeper into the expanse of Greater Atla in order to conduct investigations or respond to emergencies on homesteads.

## Borders & Smuggling

Of particular concern to Gate Patrol are wallrunners, specialized smugglers and illegal operators who use various methods to breach the Field Walls and make it into the district interior, where tracking them becomes much more difficult and falls to the Local Authority.

A strong rivalry has developed between Border Patrol and wallrunners, sometimes resulting in needless provocations and overzealous pursuit.

In recent years, more lethal equipment has been approved by the Second Quorum as wallrunning has contributed significantly to an increase in tech-related crime across the most affected districts.

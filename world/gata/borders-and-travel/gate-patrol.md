# Gate Patrol

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/gatepatrol-536.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Gate Patrol agents retrieving smuggled goods in Greater Atla.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

[GATA's](../the-basics.md) Gate Patrol consists of various personnel, including inspectors, intelligence operatives, embedded Angelis officers, specially trained border guards, and support combat units.

Gate Patrol are meant to utilize non-lethal means against suspects, however they are equipped for armed resistance and deaths do occur. Gate Patrol agents typically utilize non-lethal jelly rounds to immobilize targets.

They are typically found patrolling the perimeter of GATA's [districts](../politics/districts.md), stationed at outposts, or deployed deeper into the expanse of [Greater Atla](../politics/greater-atla.md) in order to conduct investigations or respond to emergencies on [homesteads](../politics/homesteads.md).

## Borders & Smuggling

Of particular concern to Gate Patrol are [wallrunners](../criminal-element/wallrunners.md), specialized [smugglers](../criminal-element/smugglers.md) and [illegal dark operators](../enterprise/operators.md#dark-operators) who use various methods to breach the [field walls](field-walls.md) and make it into the district interior, where tracking them becomes much more difficult and falls to the [Local Authority](../law-and-order/local-authority.md).

A strong rivalry has developed between Gate Patrol and wallrunners, sometimes resulting in needless provocations and overzealous pursuit.

In recent years, more lethal equipment has been approved by the [Second Quorum](../politics/governance.md#the-second-quorum) as wallrunning has contributed significantly to an increase in [tech-related crime](../law-and-order/tech-regulation.md) across the most affected districts.

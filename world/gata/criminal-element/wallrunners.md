# Wallrunners

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/wallrunners-f9sgf78.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A wallrunner preparing to launch.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

Wallrunners, or simply “runners”. Specialized [smugglers](smugglers.md) or illegal [operators](../enterprise/operators.md) who use various methods to breach [GATA](../)’s [Field Walls](../borders-and-travel/field-walls.md) and make it into a [district](../politics/districts.md)'s interior.

Wallrunners are named for the most common breaching method; running really fast. Wallrunners have to contend with Field Walls, [Sentinels](../borders-and-travel/sentinels.md), [Gate Patrol](../borders-and-travel/gate-patrol.md) border guards and their jelly rounds, physical obstacles, and other specialized defensive measures.

## Wallrunning

Most wallrunners employ [Sprint Gear](../../science-and-tech/gear.md#sprint-gear), [wearable gear](../../science-and-tech/gear.md) or prosthetics that allow them to achieve superhuman speed and agility while also relying heavily on strategy, deception and misdirection. Sprint Gear can be augmented with other gear to allow for boosting, stealth, misdirection, and projectile defenses. Wallrunners don't employ [static technology](../../science-and-tech/statics.md) because [static nodes](../../science-and-tech/statics.md#static-nodes) are easy to track and target without heavy shielding.

One of the most important aspects of wallrunning is building and maintaining momentum. With more kinetic energy, and the right gear loadout, wallrunners can power through many deterrents, and more easily enter a flow state, where their attention and reflexes are more attuned. Momentum allows runners to leap and slide greater distances, and increases the power available to their gear and equipment.

[Boost Gear](../../science-and-tech/gear.md#boost-gear) gives wallrunners the ability to quickly evade projectiles and avoid target lock. Boost gear allows wallrunners to boost in any direction, with some loadouts allowing a wallrunner to make their entire approach from the air.

Outside of the district walls, wallrunners contend with autonomous static weapons platforms called [Sentinels](../borders-and-travel/sentinels.md) and the highly capable Gate Patrol, but once they breach the district interior, tracking them falls to the [Local Authority](../law-and-order/local-authority.md), who are typically far less capable to address skilled runners. The Local Authority are known to sometimes contract operator runners to chase down illegal wallrunners.

### Escalation with Authorities

In recent years, more lethal equipment has been approved by [the Second Quorum](../politics/governance.md#the-second-quorum) as Wallrunning has contributed significantly to an increase in tech crime across the most affected districts.

In response to this, much more advanced Sprint Gear and counter-measures have been developed, in a constant escalatory battle between GATA and the [criminal syndicates](syndicates.md) who incentivize wallrunning activity.

# Operators

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/operators.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A crew of operators getting ready for a big job.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

People who take on commissions professionally are called "operators". This profession is all about skillful navigation of the byzantine system of [GATA](../the-basics.md). With a good reputation, track record, and specialization, operators gain access to more exclusive commissions offered by [the System](../politics/the-system.md), institutions, and other [legal enterprises](./). Sometimes referred to as "ops", or more derisively as "jobbers".

Equipped with little more than sharp minds, obscure keys and direct contacts, skilled operators can be found to perform just about any task that needs done—for the right price. Most skilled operators can find just about anything, anyone, or any information. They can get places most can’t, and they know the laws and regulations that limit them in their duties... and often how to circumvent them.

While many operators often work solo, others work in teams or small crews, and some jobs just can't be accomplished by a lone operator.

All legal commission work is recorded on, and regulated by, The System economy. In order to be a successful operator, it is critical to have [the keys](../politics/keys.md) to do what you plan to do, carry what you intend to carry, or go where you need to go.

## Working with Operators

### The Right to Uphold

Among the various fundamental rights that the [New Dawn Accords (NDA)](../politics/new-dawn-accords.md) assign to citizens "of good standing" is the right to reasonably take charge in upholding the laws of the NDA.

This means, legally speaking, all citizens are naturally deputized as legitimate agents of GATA within its territories.

In practice, the [Local Authority](../law-and-order/local-authority.md) are the ones who ultimately deem if any given case of citizen law enforcement is itself lawful, and most district’s governments frown on this activity. However, it is not uncommon for the Local Authority to enlist skilled independent Operators to assist in law enforcement by invoking the very same law.

### **Deputized Operators**

With the Right to Uphold outlined in the NDA, operators can function as commissioned law enforcement working directly for the local government or Local Authority. This relationship with local institutions can vary widely between each district, resulting in different culture and norms surrounding operators.

Some local governments rely heavily on operators to maintain the peace and can’t afford high standards, while other [district](../politics/districts.md) governments work exclusively with a few skilled operators or enterprises that meet very high standards. It would be a rare sight to see what passes for an operator in New York City stroll through the promenades of [Atla](../key-locations/atla.md).

### Dark Operators

Skilled operators with workarounds and fewer inhibitions can be hired on the black market. Illegal operator jobs are called "dark operations". Legitimate operators are often identifiable by the bright orange color of the Operators Guild on a patch or in their wardrobe, whereas an operator with no trace of orange in their garb probably offers a wider range of services.

Dark Operators can be found in Gray Zones or in the Free Territories, and their services are often much more costly. They tend to have connections with criminal syndicates, so it is best not to betray their trust or fail to pay their fees.

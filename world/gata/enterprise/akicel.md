# AKICEL

## Overview

AKICEL is one of the largest healthcare enterprises in the world. Founded by Atlan research scientists in the early years of the Reconstruction, AKICEL is a spin-off from an early Research Corps program that began during the Dark Decade, with its lineage tracing back to the very program that produced the world-changing Manna flower.

AKICEL's most well-known and profitable product to date is the Akicel therapy, a general-purpose intervention developed by sisters Aki & Hisako Koenig, based on the unique characteristics of their genomes.

At present, AKICEL is preparing to unveil blanks, their latest innovation; cloned humans who do not possess conscious experience, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, from research to labor and defense. As with many of AKICEL's products, blanks have proven to be contentious, and their trials have seen significant delays.

# AKICEL

## Overview

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/akicel.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A patient in one of AKICEL's many medical facilities around the world.</p></figcaption></figure>

AKICEL is one of the largest healthcare enterprises in the world. Founded by [Atlan](../key-locations/atla.md) research scientists in the early years of [the Reconstruction](../../history/the-reconstruction.md), AKICEL is a spin-off from an early [Research Corps](../history/the-research-corps.md) program that began during [the Dark Decade](../../history/the-dark-decade.md), with its lineage tracing back to the very program that produced the world-changing [Manna flower](../history/the-manna-flower.md).

AKICEL's most well-known and profitable product to date is the [Akicel therapy](../health-and-medicine/akicel-therapy.md), a general-purpose intervention developed by sisters Aki & Hisako Koenig, based on the unique characteristics of their genomes.

At present, AKICEL is preparing to officially unveil [blanks](../health-and-medicine/blanks.md), their latest innovation; cloned humans who do not possess conscious experience, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, from research and medicine, to labor and defense. As with many of AKICEL's products, blanks have proven to be contentious, and their trials have undergone significant delays.

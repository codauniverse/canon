# Systema

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/systema.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Technicians working in a Systema facility.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

The System is maintained by Systema, a public enterprise based in Luna that uses its lunar location to maintain and update System nodes with a secure line-of-sight connection.

Systema began as a Research Corps project undertaken over the course of the Dark Decade in a nascent Atla, and was converted into a public enterprise during GATA's founding.

Systema's Earth-based technicians make up the bulk of their workforce. Systema's administrative staff live and work on the moon. At the end of their careers, some choose to take advantage of their earned lunar keys, retiring to Sol’s Gemini City on the Dark Side of the moon.

## **Systema Structure**

#### **Headquarters**

* Located on Luna, Systema's headquarters is strategically positioned for secure line-of-sight communications with System nodes on Earth.

#### **Departments**

* Infrastructure & Maintenance: Responsible for the upkeep and updating of The System's nodes.
* Operations: Manages lunar-based facilities and staff, ensuring smooth operations on the moon.
* Research & Development: Continuously explores advancements in cybersecurity and network efficiency, although conservative with changes to the System Core.
* Personnel Affairs: Manages staff welfare, performance assistance, key allocation, and retirement planning.

#### **Staff**

* Lunar-Based Personnel: Comprises engineers, programmers, and support staff who live and work on the moon.
* Earth-Based Personnel: Provide logistical and administrative support from Earth, coordinating with district governments and lunar staff. System Technicians are often supported by contracted independent operators, which are selected by Systema as opposed to local governments or the Local Authority.

## **Systema Operations**

#### **Update Protocols:**

* Conservative Approach: Systema is extremely cautious with changes to System Core, adhering to stringent testing and validation processes.
* Scheduled Updates: Regular, scheduled updates ensure minimal disruption and maintain high security standards.
* Rolling Updates: As new modules are developed by Systema, each district receives a variation that is tailored to their System implementation, and these releases are delayed so that any bugs or vulnerabilities have time to be discovered before propagating across GATA.

#### **Security Measures:**

* Hard-Code: Systema builds all System components using hard-code; physicalized functions that can only perform a narrow range of computations. This protects The System from corruption and ensures proper function.
* Secure Line-of-Sight Communication: Utilizes the unique lunar location for secure communications with Earth-based System nodes.
* Cybersecurity Protocols: Advanced cybersecurity measures are in place to protect the integrity of The System’s messages.
* Angelis Partnership: Systema deploys System Technicians accompanied by Angelis tactical units to deploy and maintain remote sensor arrays that provide critical input for The System.

#### **Collaboration with AIC:**

* Regulatory Compliance: Systema works closely with the AIC to ensure that updates and maintenance align with regulatory standards and global policies.
* Patching: Systema programmers design System patch modules and their on-the-ground technicians install them.
* Information Sharing: Systema and the AIC share vital information regarding cyber threats, technological advancements, and policy changes.
* Advisory Role: Systema representatives serve an advisory role to the AIC, providing insights into the technical capabilities and limitations of The System.

#### **Risk Management:**

* Contingency Planning: Systema maintains contingency plans for various risk scenarios, including cyber-attacks, technical failures, or natural disasters.
* Regular Audits and Reviews: Continuous monitoring and periodic audits ensure the ongoing reliability and security of The System.

#### **Controlled Innovation:**

* Research Focus: While conservative with core changes, Systema invests in research to stay ahead in technology and cybersecurity.
* Research Corps Partnership: The Research Corps has been critical in helping Systema make necessary leaps in developing The System. When Systema reaches a critical impasse, The Research Corps is seemingly always there with the solution.
* Incremental Improvements: Emphasizes gradual, tested improvements over radical changes to maintain stability.

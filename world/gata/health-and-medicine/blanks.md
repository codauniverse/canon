# Blanks

Developed by Akicel in a joint enterprise between GATA and New Imperial Japan. Blanks are cloned human bodies with near exact replicas of template brains, but provably without consciousness.

In order to create a blank, a deceased brain must be ‘flipped’, a process similar to embalming or injection molding, however using a nano-fluid that floods every feature of the brain and holds its state as a lattice for Akicel cell cultures during the clone maturation process. The flipping process destroys the original brain.

As per GATA regulations, blanks are visually differentiated from regular humans through an extreme induced albinism.

### Understanding Blanks

Blanks are a contentious development, given that they are living human tissue, however just one conversation with a blank often rids people of their reservations; blanks are stoic, nearly motionless when at rest, and entirely without affect.

When asked directly if they are conscious, a blank would reply that they are not. Using scanners calibrated to detect signals of consciousness confirm as much. They possess all of the knowledge and capabilities of their ‘template’, but they lack an internal world, or any spark of intentionality, due to precise modifications of their brain's structure.

A blank will follow any order their template would have followed, or answer any question about their life with savant-like capabilities, and they can also perform incredible calculations and mental feats that would have been beyond the capabilities of their originator. Their ability to learn or adapt is extremely limited.

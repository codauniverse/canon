# Akicel Therapy

## Overview

The Akicel Therapy is a well-known treatment for age-related dysfunction across the entire body. Used in moderation, Akicel therapy significantly reduces all-cause mortality. Higher doses can have strong rejuvenative effects on superficial signs of aging.

Akicel therapy is derived from the Aki Genome, the genetic code responsible for the immortal cells of Aki Koenig, AKICEL's namesake. Aki's cells demonstrate near perfect replication, bestowing upon her near perfect health and longevity. Akicel therapy introduces plasma infused with copies of these cells into a patient's bloodstream.

The usual regimen for most patients is one Akicel treatment a year after the age of 16, and no more than one full treatment every two months. Akicel use at this rate reduces most individuals’ apparent rate of aging by 30-70%.

Excessive use of Akicel therapy has been connected with numerous side effects. The therapy should only be administered by a trained professional in controlled settings, and patients should be monitored for 12 hours following their treatment.

### **Rejuvenation**

AKICEL's Rejuvenation protocol is an intensive form of Akicel therapy only offered by AKICEL’s in-house team, requiring highly specialized equipment and a personally tailored formula.

A single Rejuvenation treatment can reduce a patients apparent age by 3-10 years, and they can return for another course as soon as one year after their last treatment.

Rejuvenation is fairly hard on the body for the following months as the body undergoes continuous and rapid autophagy and hormone levels change. Bones, joints, and soft tissue may itch or ache to some degree.

At present, Rejuvenation is considerably expensive, which has made it politically controversial and largely inaccessible to the public.

## **Rejection Syndrome**

Some individuals do not respond well to Akicel therapy and Rejuvenation treatments in particular. This is called "rejection syndrome", and the reaction can be severe and even deadly.&#x20;

Rejection syndrome symptoms are similar to a fast-acting cancer or flesh-eating disease. There is no known cure. Once someone with rejection syndrome falls severely ill, they rarely recover. This is not the cause of AKICEL’s therapy per say, but rather the individual’s immune system.

Patients must be screened before AKICEL's therapies are administered to ensure that their cells are compatible.

Rejection syndrome is not common in GATA where regulations require proper sequencing and blood tests prior to treatment.

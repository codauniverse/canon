# Terminals

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/nomoney420_a_sci_fi_terminal_in_a_public_place_shaped_like_an_A_8c2b2d98-edec-44f3-a850-8d3a12d5ae5a.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>System Terminals in one of GATA's districts.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

Terminals are public or private interfaces that allow the user to interact with systems. Using private terminals can sometimes be risky or unreliable if you are not sure what system it is connected to.

Terminals generally look like kiosks with built in volumetric hologram displays. Modern terminals are robust and minimal, and can project entire private constructs either direct-to-retina, or via link.

The most ubiquitous terminals found across [GATA](../gata/) are [System Terminals](../gata/politics/the-system.md#system-terminals) which allow GATA's citizens to perform a wide variety of daily functions.

## Private Terminals

Private enterprise is relied on to deploy and maintain their own builds of System terminals in underserviced and high-demand areas.&#x20;

Private terminals provide access to the enterprise's private ecosystem, as well as other third-party networks and services for users with the requisite keys.

## Terminal Spoofing

Local gangs and organized criminal operations have been known to make illegal dummy terminals that connect to their own phantom endpoint, allowing them to siphon private citizen and enterprise data. This is a crime that falls to the Local Authority to address; failure to do so can negatively impact their standing, affecting their System Yield.

While it is likely some of the more sophisticated criminal organizations possess the expertise necessary to spoof System terminals, there are only a few known cases of this occurring, and in all cases the guilty parties were apprehended. The aversion to targeting System terminals is likely inspired by the threat of overstepping the jurisdiction of Angelis.

# Grabbers

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/grabbers.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A grabber glove.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

Equipment and gauntlets that allow the user to ‘grab’ onto a point in space and either attract or repel themselves from it. Grabbers are the product of continued development in static and link technology. A skilled [conduit](links.md#conduits) can grab and move objects at a distance.&#x20;

Grabbers are not widely paradigmed for civilian use, however they can be found in use across all of GATA's district shipping yards.

## Usage

The sensation of grabbing is unique. When attracting oneself toward a point, or an object towards oneself, the user will have the feeling that the object is pushing on them. An inexperienced conduit can even be pushed off balance if they’re unprepared. The further away a target, the more difficult it is to get a firm grip.

In order to attract an object, the user has to push into the resistance. This repulsion effect is actually something an experienced conduit can use as a form of locomotion, fall-breaking and even an offensive attack.

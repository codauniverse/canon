# Psychotech

## Overview

Compact modules containing cognitive subroutines that can be physically installed into compatible [link implants](links.md) with expansion ports. Older link implants donâ€™t have the necessary ports for modular psychotech, but some early implants with embedded psychotech were explored. Embedded psychotech has largely been abandoned for the more modular, extensible approach.

Psychotech, or "psychs" for short, can confer knowledge, basic instincts, complex mental operations, heightened motor function, and other states of mind. Designer psychs can be acquired by those who know where to look, and a market for [recreational](../gata/underground-scene/recreational-drugs.md) psychs has emerged in recent years across the [Free Territories](../free-territories/) and in [the underground scene](../gata/underground-scene/) found in [Gray Zones](../gata/politics/gray-zones.md).

Unstable or corrupted psychotech can be dangerous and potentially cause irreversible long-term damage to its user.

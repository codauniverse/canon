# Frames

## Overview

Frames are anthropomorphic mechanized chassis' controlled by a conduit operator, designed for a multitude of applications, from military operations to construction, shipping, and resource extraction.

Originating as armored "war frames" developed by the Joint Atlantic Command (JAC), they were later fielded by Atla to secure important strategic locations in combat. Frames are named for their skeletal chassis, which provides a versatile and familiar, anthropomorphic form factor that enhances dexterity and operator compatibility.

***

## History

The development of frames began during the Dark Decade, with the JAC seeking advanced armored units capable of bridging the operational gap between ground-based units like tanks and infantry, and aerial units like fighters jets and drones.

These early war frames proved invaluable both heavy combat and versatile field operations, and were particularly impactful in holding strategic locations. Their success led to the broader application of frame technology across various sectors.

Over time, frames evolved from purely military assets to essential tools in construction, resource extraction, and other fields requiring robust, adaptable machinery and great physical force.

## Design and Functionality

Frames are characterized by their somewhat humanoid design, typically featuring arms and legs that allow them to ambulate and manipulate their environment with high precision. This design makes Frames highly intuitive for operators, leveraging natural muscle memory and proprioception for seamless control.

Some frames' form factors are more familiar, with two arms and two legs, while others are constructed with multiple, unorthodox appendages, and atypical postures and ambulatory patterns. The frame's chassis is tailored to its intended function, and elite frame operators are often equipped with frames that are designed to their personal specifications.

### **Key Features:**

#### Dexterity

Frames can perform complex, nuanced tasks thanks to their articulated limbs and hands, making them ideal for a wide range of applications.

#### Versatility

Frames can be re-equipped with different tools and weapons, allowing for rapid adaptation to various tasks and missions.

#### Strength

The strong structural chassis of Frames allows them to carry heavy loads and withstand significant stress, making them suitable for demanding environments.

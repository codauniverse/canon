# Frames

## Overview

Frames are mechanized exoskeletons controlled by a conduit operator, designed for a multitude of applications, from military operations to construction, shipping, and resource extraction.

Originating as armored "war frames" developed by the Joint Atlantic Command (JAC), they were later fielded by Atla to secure important strategic locations in combat. Frames are named for their skeletal chassis, which provides a familiar, anthropomorphic form factor that enhances dexterity and operator compatibility.

## History

The development of Frames began during the Dark Decade, with the JAC seeking advanced armored units capable of both heavy combat and versatile field operations. These early war frames proved invaluable in holding strategic locations, and their success led to the broader application of frame technology across various sectors.

Over time, Frames evolved from purely military assets to essential tools in construction, resource extraction, and other fields requiring robust, adaptable machinery.

## Design and Functionality

Frames are characterized by their humanoid design, typically featuring arms and legs that allow them to ambulate and manipulate their environment with high precision. This design makes Frames highly intuitive for operators, leveraging natural muscle memory and proprioception for seamless control.

### **Key Features:**

#### Dexterity

Frames can perform complex, nuanced tasks thanks to their articulated limbs and hands, making them ideal for a wide range of applications.

#### Versatility

Frames can be re-equipped with different tools and weapons, allowing for rapid adaptation to various tasks and missions.

#### Strength

The strong structural chassis of Frames allows them to carry heavy loads and withstand significant stress, making them suitable for demanding environments.

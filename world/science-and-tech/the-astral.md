# The Astral

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/astral.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A stunning view within the Astral, with the famed Crystal Tower looming in the distance.</p></figcaption></figure>

## **Overview**

The Astral is a novel kind of virtual construct that exists entirely in the minds of the users who are connected to it. Users access the Astral using [links](links.md) and modified [sync hubs](sync-hubs.md) with an astral seed module that is entangled with its sibling astral seeds, allowing instantaneous synchronization between participants.

This modification of sync hubs is illegal and connecting to the Astral is a Class 1 crime. However, this has not prevented a growing subculture of Astral users from taking root, particularly among [sleepers](../gata/people-and-culture/sleepers.md) who already spend most of their lives within [virtual constructs](constructs.md#virtual-constructs).

Sleepers and others usually learn about the Astral and gain access to their secretive networks via illegal offline constructs that have been known to circulate around [dormitory communities](../gata/people-and-culture/sleepers.md#dormitories), leading to increasing scrutiny of dormitories by [the AIC](../gata/institutions/atlan-information-control.md).

## The Astral Experience

Within the astral, users are confronted with impossible environments and bizarre architecture clashing and blending, with structures and weather-like phenomena that defy natural laws. The astral has a soft, dream-like quality, and users have the sensation that details often only appear when they look to see them. With focused effort, astral users can change the environments, create objects, and affect the astral environment in many other ways.

Materials within the astral tend to have distinct qualities, with crystal, stone, and glass being the easiest materials to manipulate and create with. The air seems to have a thick atmospheric quality, and clouds can always be seen sliding across the distant horizon. Thick clouds and fog are a common sight, but can typically be dispelled with focused attention. Some regions of the astral are easier to manifest and manipulate than others, however no one is sure why. In general, very little is known about the astral.

### Advanced techniques

With practice, users can learn to fly, see through solid materials, change their appearance, project themselves great distances instantaneously, and can even be present in multiple locations at once, to name only a few of the abilities observed in the astral.

Experienced users also report that there is a constraint within the astral that they refer to as "cause and effect" which can be used to engineer rational practices, objects and structures that cause the astral to behave in predictable and repeatable ways.

One famous example of astral engineering is the Crystal Tower created by an early astral user that can be manifested on the horizon by simply turning around and expecting to see it. The Crystal Tower serves as a common meeting place, and lost astral frequently travelers rely on the tower whenever they become lost in the astral's unmeasurable expanse.

## **Astral Seeds**

Astral seeds are entangled [quantum seeds](quantum-seeds.md) that allow Astral users to interact directly and instantly with other minds on the network over any distance.

Seeds that are entangled together in the activation process are called cohorts. There are only ten thousand Astral seeds in the first cohort, and they are exceedingly rare. It’s estimated that there are over fifty entangled cohorts of astral seeds connected to the Astral, with the largest consisting of over two million seeds.

It is estimated that there are over ten million Astral users worldwide.

## **Bridgers**

‘Bridgers’ are Astral users who have connected multiple astral seeds to their sync hub, allowing them to function as connectors between the various cohorts. Bridging requires at least two link implants. Bridgers are almost exclusively "sleepers" who, either by preference or due to other material conditions, spend the entirety of their waking lives within virtual or astral constructs.

## Residual

As with virtual constructs, extended periods spent in the astral run the risk of very powerful residual effects. Astral residual is notably more pronounced than virtual residual, and can present with symptoms such as phantom sensations, vivid flashbacks, auditory and visual hallucinations, derealization, and depersonalization.

Unlike virtual residual, heavy astral users experiencing powerful residual effects have extremely high conviction that there is something real about the residual, even when not exhibiting symptoms of psychosis or manias, which typically accompany such claims with virtual residual.

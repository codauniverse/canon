# Pockets

## Overview

Among the numerous novel space-time manipulating technologies developed by ALTAR.

Pockets are discreet spaces that appear at precise energetic thresholds that open up small manifolds in spacetime–essentially, small, reproducible pocket universes–to create hyperbolic storage space.

Pockets are being actively studied by the Research Corps in Sol, however they are not paradigmed anywhere in GATA, not even Atla, but as with any mysterious thing, unsubstantiated rumors of this technology being seen in the wild occasionally circulate.

The technology was originally being investigated in hopes of creating a method for instantaneous travel between two remote locations, however this research is presently incomplete. It is believed by some experts that Quantum Seeds may hold the key to unlocking this incredible advancement.

# Pockets

## Overview

Among the numerous novel space-time manipulating technologies developed by ALTAR.

Pockets are discreet spaces that appear at precise energetic thresholds that open up small manifolds in space-time–essentially, small, reproducible pocket universes–to create hyperbolic storage space.

## Design & Usage

A ring-shaped apparatus called a "ring" or "pocket ring" is tuned to a specific energetic frequency called an "address", allowing it to access a specific pocket. Because the range of possible pockets is virtually infinite, accessing a pocket's address requires a ring tuned to the correct address.

Rings can theoretically be constructed in any size, however the energy required increases geometrically, constraining the currently known prototype rings to a maximum diameter of roughly 30cm.

While the ring itself is portable, it must be connected to a huge supply of power in order to open up its addressed pocket, making their practical use highly restrictive. If a ring is damaged or destroyed, its pocket will be rendered lost, ostensibly forever.

## Ongoing Research

Pockets are being actively studied by the Research Corps in Sol, however they are not paradigmed anywhere in GATA, not even Atla, but as with any mysterious thing, unsubstantiated rumors of this technology being seen in the wild occasionally circulate.

The technology was originally being investigated in hopes of creating a method for instantaneous travel between two remote locations, however this research is presently incomplete. It is believed by some experts that Quantum Seeds may hold the key to unlocking this incredible advancement.

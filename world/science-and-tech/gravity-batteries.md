# Gravity Batteries

## Overview

Gravity batteries are an energy storage technology designed to harness potential energy stored in masses—typically weights or blocks—which are lifted and then allowed to fall. This mechanism converts potential energy into electrical energy using generators.

This ingenious and relatively low-tech solution is comparable to pumped hydro storage, but instead of water, it uses solid masses like concrete blocks.

Gravity batteries pair well with renewable energy generation which has variable availability due to changes in weather and climate, allowing energy to be stored for later use. They are particularly popular in remote regions and rural communities where fusion reactors are not readily accessible or affordable.

## Mechanism

The operation of gravity batteries consists of two main phases: energy storage (charging) and energy release (discharging).

During the charging phase, excess electricity, often generated from renewable sources like wind or solar power, is used to power motors that lift heavy weights to a higher elevation, thereby storing potential energy.

In the discharging phase, when there is a demand for electricity, these weights are allowed to fall, and their potential energy is converted back into electrical energy through generators.

## Benefits

Gravity batteries offer several key advantages:

* **Sustainability:** Utilizing abundant and non-toxic materials, they pose minimal environmental risks.
* **Longevity:** With minimal wear and tear compared to chemical batteries, they boast a long operational lifespan.
* **Scalability:** They can be easily scaled up or down to meet different energy storage needs.
* **Efficiency:** High round-trip efficiency, typically around 80-90%, makes them a reliable choice for energy storage.&#x20;

## Usage

Gravity batteries are widely adopted in various regions and communities, and are particularly prevalent in the Free Territories, Aryabat, and among Homesteaders in Greater Atla. In these areas, the need for sustainable, low-maintenance, and reliable energy storage solutions has driven the adoption of gravity batteries.

# Fusion Energy

## Overview

The primary central power generation for most of [GATA](../gata/)’s [districts](../gata/politics/districts.md), as well as [New Imperial Japan](../new-imperial-japan/), [URSA](../ursa/), and [the Free Territories](../free-territories/). While GATA uses their own fusion energy technology, URSA and Free Territories are reliant on New Imperial Japan’s fusion technology.

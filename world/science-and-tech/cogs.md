# COGs

## Overview

COGs are cognitive systems. They are [Asimovian](asimovian-architecture.md) constructs derived from the Fischer equation, capable of generalized reason.

Due to the design constraints of Asimovian architecture, cogs are quite largeâ€“ranging in scale from roughly two cubic feet to the size of a large warehouse, based on the tension between the system's required speed and complexity.

The key to understanding the mind of an Asimov-complete cog is that each cog represents a wholistic framework for reasoning, and its "cognition" is pseudo-deterministic, which are requirements outlined in the [New Dawn Accords](../gata/politics/new-dawn-accords.md).

COGs do not learn over time. They simply take any input, roll the information around internally, sifting it and reducing it until its rational peaks emerge, and then return the result which is then interpreted by a separate natural language module, such as [VOX](cogs.md#vox). They have no memory.

Cogs all function using the same fundamental principles of cognitive architecture (Observation, Planning, Selection, Execution).

Illegal cogs that incorporate non-deterministic cognition are not unheard of, however [the AIC](../gata/institutions/atlan-information-control-aic.md) and [Collections](../gata/law-and-order/collections.md) quickly and decisively crack down on these installations, even outside of Greater Atla's territory with the assistance of [Angelis](../gata/military-and-defense/angelis.md).

## **Notable COGs**

#### VOX

A simple, lightweight, widely-available cog module that provides a natural language interface for systems. The common alternative to [links](links.md) for advanced system interactions.

VOX allows regular people to speak or type and interact with systems in relatively complex ways. VOX is one of the most commonly used interfaces for [System Terminals](../gata/politics/the-system.md#system-terminals).

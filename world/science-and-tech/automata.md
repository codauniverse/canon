# Automata

Automata are autonomous robots designed to perform simple tasks in the environment. They are essentially walking (or flying or rolling or burrowing) physical functions.

Sometimes, automata are connected to a nearby local compute platform, including [System](../gata/politics/the-system.md) [endpoints](endpoints.md). They can look like inanimate parts of the environment, or mechanical insects and animals, and many things in between. Common automata include the [static gondolas](statics.md#gondolas) and [other moving platforms](statics.md#static-engines-and-motion) found across [GATA](../gata/), and the ‘bugs’ that maintain natural and artificial ecosystems.

## Types of Automata

### **Anthros**

Anthro is short for anthropomorphic automata. Like all other automata, they do almost no processing onboard due to the limitations imposed by [AIC regulation](../gata/institutions/atlan-information-control.md), thus requiring wired connections to the platform driving them (or a human conduit to embody them as surrogates). Connecting an athro to local hardware can give them a wide range of capabilities.

### **Bugs**

Small robotic automata that perform basic status assessment and maintenance in public spaces. They can climb walls, slip between cracks and perform a variety of functions, but in order to be [NDA](../gata/politics/new-dawn-accords.md)-compliant their onboard computation capacity is very limited.

### Trajectoids

Objects, most often seen as large environmental automata that transform spaces based on needs. If a space’s use might change, or certain tasks must be performed in the space, these trajectoids can simply be activated by a conduit and they will safely move themselves into a predetermined position without requiring a skilled [conduit](links.md#conduits) (or [cogs](cogs.md)).

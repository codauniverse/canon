# Statics

## Overview

Static Field technology, or statics for short, uses ‘[static nodes](statics.md#static-nodes)’ to position and move objects, crafts, platforms, and structures within the Earth’s gravitational field, or ‘static field’ as it relates to static technology. Statics are much more prevalent in GATA's districts and across Greater Atla, however they can also be found in use within all of GATA's partner states. Conversely, they are a rarer sight in URSA and rarer still across the Free Territories.

## **Static Nodes**

Static nodes are small polyhedral components whose position in its surrounding gravitational field can be modulated by applying a charge to the node.

When a high charge is applied to an inactive node, the node slowly becomes more "static" in the gravitational field. When the current is cut, the node holds its relative position in the gravitational field indefinitely until the exact same frequency of charge is first applied and then slowly entrained down, at which time the node will loosen again. The charge necessary to loosen a regulation "firm" node is extremely high and must be applied for some time before the node will come loose.

A loose node can be moved manually through the magnetic field, although the amount of resistance is determined by the charge that was entrained. Loose nodes have opened up a wide range of applications in industry and enterprise, and in particular, static engines.

The number of nodes determines the way in which an object can orient in the gravitational field. A single, firm node is useful as an anchor for architecture and infrastructure. Two nodes can be used to create platforms that can be moved horizontally along the Earth's magnetic field. In order to achieve locomotion, three nodes are required.

Static nodes can range from 5 cm in diameter to 1 meter. The diameter of the node's core determines how quickly the node's resonant frequency can be entrained up or down. Smaller nodes can approach up to 90% firmness very quickly, permitting faster, more agile movement—but the last 10% of firmness would require an asymptotically higher current. Larger nodes take quite a while to reach 90% firmness, but reaching 99.9999% firmness is much faster and more energy efficient than with smaller nodes.

Static nodes are made possible by advances in material sciences pioneered by Atla’s [Research Corps](../sol/institutions/the-research-corps.md) during [The Reconstruction](../history/the-reconstruction.md) era.

## **Static Engines & Motion**

Static engines continuously modulate the charge applied to three or more nodes to produce smooth, stable movement within the Earth’s gravitational field. Static engines are essential for transporting extremely heavy loads, as demonstrated during the Reconstruction with GATA's long-defunct staging platforms that crawled the skies of Greater Atla.

With modern, miniaturized static engines, extremely fast and expressive movement can be achieved, as many have discovered with the recent rise in the popularity of [darts](statics.md#dart-boards)–static boards that have become central to an extreme [sport culture](../gata/people-and-culture/sports.md) that is intertwined with the [counterculture scene](../gata/underground-scene/).

Smaller static vehicles are reliant on compact batteries to power their static engines, while larger ships and platforms employ fusion reactors to power their larger static engines. Meanwhile, New Imperial Japan, URSA and various Free Territories utilize much smaller fusion cells, giving them advantages in certain military and industrial applications where their statics can operate indefinitely.

Prominent statics manufacturers include Pegasus (GATA), Nimbus (GATA), and Gibraltar (AU).

#### Ships

Vehicles of various size with different configurations of static engines. The most popular mode of inter-district travel, and increasingly affordable for civilian use. Static ships can be used in trans-medium travel, functional in air, water, and space.

#### Rafts

Small, simple static platforms made for ferrying heavy cargo and equipment across shorter distances. Used widely in industrial, law enforcement, and military contexts.

#### Gondolas

These moving extensions of urban architecture are a common form of public transportation in districts. Gondolas typically take the form of small platforms with handrails, and sometimes seating.

#### Dart Boards

Highly maneuverable personal conveyance devices with static engines. Popular among the youth, and sometimes finely tuned for high-performance.

#### Platforms

Large static platforms that serve as staging areas for construction, industry, and military operations. The most famous static platform is the [Azure Plateau](../sol/key-locations/azure-plateau.md).

#### Tankers

Large static vehicles used for large scale shipping. Tankers are used to transport [System Yield](../gata/politics/yield.md).

#### Skyliners

Large luxury static ships used for travel and leisure. Skyliners are a popular form of travel between districts, or to remote [luxury homesteads](../gata/politics/homesteads.md#luxury-homesteads) found across Greater Atla.

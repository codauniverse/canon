# Emitters

## Overview

Emitters are used to project holograms.

There are two varieties; spatial emitters which project the hologram into the air, giving them a translucent ‘ghost-like’ quality. These are used most often in public spaces.

Then there are direct emitters which project imagery directly into the retina of the target. Direct emissions are indistinguishable from solid objects in the space, and are often used for more private experiences and environments.

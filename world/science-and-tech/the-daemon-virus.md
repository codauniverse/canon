# The Daemon Virus

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/daemon.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A computer system infected with the Daemon Virus, aka BODYSNATCHER.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

A computer virus from the [Old World](../history/the-old-world.md) that has infected most [legacy technology](../gata/law-and-order/tech-regulation.md). Commonly referred to as “The Daemon” by the people, however researchers refer to the pernicious code as BODYSNATCHER.

The BODYSNATCHER algorithm handily writes itself onto legacy computer hardware–anything with a general purpose processor– and begins monitoring and mimicking the functionality of the existing software, substituting pieces of the original code with its own API, before ultimately taking over the system. Hence the name “BODYSNATCHER”, given by early forensic researchers in the [Joint Atlantic Command](../gata/history/the-joint-atlantic-command-jac.md) flotilla (which later evolved into [Atla](../gata/key-locations/atla.md)).

When the Daemon was discovered on computer systems around the world by technicians from Atla during the early days of the Dark Decade, its presence was immediately distressing.

## Understanding the Daemon

Researchers discovered that when a BODYSNATCHER-infected system detects that it has been discovered, the code ‘self-corrupts’, rendering the host hardware non-functional.

BODYSNATCHER’s infestation of all legacy technology meant that the Old World’s vast, connected infrastructure was now useless. From mining operations to factories, powerplants to satellites, everything would have to be rebuilt from scratch. And it would have to be rebuilt in a way that was immune to the Daemon– or any similar threat.

Research on BODYSNATCHER was critical in informing the [New Dawn Accords](../gata/politics/new-dawn-accords.md), [Asimovian architecture](asimovian-architecture.md), and the design of [The System](../gata/politics/the-system.md).

Recently studies of BODYSNATCHER may confirm its long-suspected role in the onset of the [Dark Decade](../history/the-dark-decade.md), however additional research is required.

#### Attempts to Address the Daemon

Researchers discovered that if one can successfully circumvent all of BODYSNATCHER’s modes of detecting if it is being watched, it is possible to “bodysnatch” BODYSNATCHER. Once overtaken, BODYSNATCHER can be compelled to self-annihilate.

While it was originally hoped that this technique would produce a panacea for the virus, this discovery revealed a yet-unseen behavior from the virus. When BODYSNATCHER is forced to self destruct in this way, any connected descendent infected machines also self-destruct, potentially causing a critical cascade across an entire network.

It is believed by some that this could be the mechanism that initiated The Crash, however much remains unknown about the virus and its origins.

# Artificial Intelligence

## Overview

In GATA and its partner states, AI is strictly regulated under the [NDA](../gata/politics/new-dawn-accords.md). General purpose processors are illegal specifically due to the threat posed by AI and destructive algorithms like the [Daemon virus](the-daemon-virus.md).

This limitation drove the development of [Asimovian computers](asimovian-architecture.md); application-specific compute platforms that are secure and predictable. As a result of this move toward [hard code](hard-code.md), all legal artificial intelligence today takes the form of [cogs](cogs.md), Asimov-complete hard-coded cognitive systems that can only perceive and compute within a carefully limited scope called an ‘[ontology](asimovian-architecture.md#ontology-design)’.

## **AI in the Old World**

Even before [the Dark Decade](../history/the-dark-decade.md), AI had remained a contentious issue as it had enabled a ubiquitous form of social spying and a market for private data, resulting in numerous societal clashes and scandals.

While for many in the [Old World](../history/the-old-world.md), a resigned acceptance had set in, others protested and suffered from blacklisting and criminalization in many areas of society. The popular sentiment among [Atla](../gata/key-locations/atla.md)’s founding citizens was that AI, together with a malignant form of short-sighted competition, had created the conditions for [The Crash](../history/the-crash.md).

# Helios

## Overview

Helios is Sol’s primary military enterprise, with roughly the same relationship to Sol as Angelis has with GATA. Sol government provides oversight and authorization for Helios activity, with its mandate to secure the heliosphere against unlawful conduct. Sol’s jurisdiction extends outward from the Dark Side of the Moon to the edge of the heliosphere, including Gemini City.

Most of Helios' field operatives are conduits based in Gemini City, who link with remote platforms to work in coordination with Rangers during their assignments.

Rangers are generally assigned to outposts across the solar system to scout and secure remote sites, protect scientific missions, or assist rock fishers in crisis.

GATA often turns to Sol and Helios for assistance in intelligence gathering, and space-based challenges. In practice, Sol and Helios function as extensions of GATA and Angelis, respectively.

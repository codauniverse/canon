# Azure Plateau

## Overview

A Sol-owned geosynchronous orbital luxury habitat positioned outside of Sol’s jurisdiction and inside of the Earth’s upper atmosphere. The Plateau is where most diplomatic and ceremonial affairs between Sol and Earth are addressed.

The Plateau has a massive static field atrium containing the atmosphere of a grand plaza overlooking the Earth.

The station is shaped like a tall pyramid with the plateau on its broad face facing toward the Earth, and it rotates around its axis of travel, completing a full rotation every 6 hours. This gives visitors to the plateau 1.5 hours to gaze in wonder at an unspoiled view of the stars beyond our own.

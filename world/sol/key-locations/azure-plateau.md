# Azure Plateau

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/azureplateau.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A crowd of tourists Earth gazing from the Azure Plateau.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Overview

A Sol-owned geosynchronous orbital habitat located inside of GATA-controlled space in the Earthâ€™s upper atmosphere. The Plateau is where most diplomatic and ceremonial affairs between Sol and Earth are addressed.

The Plateau has numerous viewing platforms, including a large field wall atrium containing an atmosphere over a grand plaza overlooking the Earth.

The station is shaped like a tall pyramid with the plateau on its broad face pointed toward the Earth, and it rotates around its axis of travel, completing a full rotation every 6 hours. This gives visitors to the plateau 1.5 hours to gaze in wonder at an unspoiled view of the stars beyond our own.

# Gemini

### Overview

Gemini is Luna’s twin city in the Mare Ingenii Region on the dark side of the moon. Gemini’s founding habitat was originally abandoned during the Dark Decade before being revitalized during Reconstruction. Its nearby spaceports serve as critical waypoints for solar traffic, premium long-term material storage, and staging for the lunar-stationary shipyards.

The underground city houses some of the most awe inspiring megalithic environments carved out of the lunar interiors hollowed during early quarrying. Though some mining continues nearby, closer to the moon’s South Pole, activity in those mines continue to decline as Aryabat starfishers have vastly increased access to resources further afield.

#### Living in Gemini

Life in Gemini City is quite a bit more exclusive, especially since the decline in lunar industrial operations. The city is primarily occupied by lunar locals, Helios personnel, and the affluent who must take charge of any Earth visitors they invite; the System in Gemini requires a resident signator or guarantor for all interactions, a condition that actually applies by treaty to every habitat on the Moon with the exception of Luna and homesteader dwellings on the Earth side of the moon.

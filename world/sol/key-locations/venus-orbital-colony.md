# Venus Orbital Colony

### Overview

A constellation of habitats in Venus’ upper atmosphere. The Venus colony began as a Sol research mission, but the abundance of organic molecules in Venus’ atmosphere made life above Venus relatively easy to maintain compared to other off-world colonies. As a result, Venus is home to a population of 12,000 staff, civilians and long-term visitors.

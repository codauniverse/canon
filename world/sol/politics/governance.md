# Governance

## Overview

The government of Sol is minimal. Its main responsibilities, beyond ensuring the well-being of its citizens, is enforcing the regulatory constraints of the New Dawn Accords within Sol, and providing oversight and authorization for the activities of its primary enterprise, Helios.

Sol is a sister nation to GATA and was branched from GATA during the Reconstruction in order to set the stage for GATA's goal to make humanity multi-planetary. Sol's administrative branch is based in Gemini, however as a consequence of its Atlan origins, many of its government officials continue to live and work in Atla, coordinating closely with the First and Second Quorums in their mutual affairs.

The Sol government's mandate notably includes securing the heliosphere against NDA infractions. Sol's jurisdiction spans from the Dark Side of the Moon to the edge of the heliosphere, encompassing Gemini City and the interplanetary space of the solar system beyond.

## Leadership

#### Council of Overseers

Given the small population and the strategic importance of Sol, a Council of Overseers could lead the government. This council, comprised of seasoned leaders from various sectors (science, military, economics, and civic administration), would provide balanced and experienced governance. They are selected based on merit and experience, ensuring that the leaders have a deep understanding of both the technical and societal aspects of life in Sol.

#### Prime Overseer

Acting as the head of the Council, the Prime Overseer would oversee the overall governance, coordinate with Helios, and represent Sol in interplanetary affairs. This role requires a blend of diplomatic skill, military understanding, and administrative acumen. Thus far, all of Sol’s Prime Overseers have come from a military background.

## Key Positions

#### Helios Liaison

Responsible for coordinating with Helios, ensuring that the military and civilian sectors work in tandem for the security and advancement of Sol.

#### Chief Scientist

Overseeing scientific endeavors, space exploration initiatives, and technological development within Sol. This role is crucial given the importance of scientific advancement in space communities. The Chief Scientist ensures that Sol’s operations comply with New Dawn Accords regulations.

#### Habitat Administrators

Each individual “habitat” has an Administrator tasked with managing the living conditions, resources, and sustainable development of the highly secured, regimented off-planet habitats. Their role is critical in maintaining the balance between resource utilization and conservation.

#### Diplomatic Envoy

Handling Sol's relationships with other entities like GATA and other Earth governments. They play a key role in intelligence sharing, diplomatic negotiations, and collaborative projects. While officially intended as a neutral party, they are ultimately beholden to the interests of Sol which is deeply integrated with GATA, both historically and politically.

## Functioning

#### **Decision-Making**

The Council of Overseers operates on a consensus model for major decisions, while individual members have autonomy in their specific domains. This structure allows for efficient decision-making while ensuring that all aspects of Sol's society are considered. The Council are advised by Habitat Administrators.

#### **Public Involvement**

Despite the small population, public involvement in governance is encouraged through periodic assemblies in their local habitats. This fosters a sense of community and ensures that the voices of the citizens are heard in the governance process, through the Administrators.

#### **Security and Order**

Given the high-security needs of Sol and its habitats, a robust legal framework governs everything from daily life to extraordinary circumstances. Helios soldiers, operatives, and Rangers ensure enforcement of these laws and maintain order across Sol’s jurisdiction.

#### **Resource Management**

Due to the limited and precious nature of resources in space habitats, the government places a strong emphasis on sustainable resource management, recycling, and innovative solutions for self-sufficiency.

#### **Emergency Response & Crisis Management**

A specialized team under the Habitat Administrator is dedicated to handling emergencies, whether technical, environmental, or medical, ensuring the safety and well-being of all inhabitants.

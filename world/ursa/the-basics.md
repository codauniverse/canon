# üîµ The Basics

A constitutional oligarchy born during the dark decade. Stands as a testament to human resilience and reinvention. Governed by a house representing its 215 feudal 'kingdoms'. Its capitol and center of commerce is Tashkent, which came to prominence in the region in wake of mass Russian migration. While decried as corrupt, URSA's complex web of reliance, grievance and retribution maintains its ever-re-balancing, dynamic order. Struggles with environmental obstacles caused by nuclear detonations and permafrost melt in the aftermath of the Dark Decade. URSA's leadership accuses GATA of using their climate regime to force URSA into adopting The System.

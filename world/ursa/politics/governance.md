# Governance

### Leadership

#### The House of Kingdoms

At the top of URSA's governance is the House of Kingdoms, a council-like body representing each of the 215 feudal kingdoms. This House functions similarly to a parliamentary body but with more direct control over their respective regions. Each kingdom, reflective of the diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds spanning Russia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, sends a representative to the House, often a noble (called ‘crowns’) or an appointed official with deep roots in the local culture and politics. The representative of a Kingdom is called a Throne.

#### Regional Assemblies

Each kingdom has its own assembly, a microcosm of the House of Kingdoms, dealing with local governance. These assemblies are responsible for maintaining order, implementing policies from the House, and addressing local issues. They are composed of crowns, local leaders, influential figures, and representatives of significant cultural or ethnic groups within the kingdom.

#### The Executive Council

A smaller, more centralized body within the House of Kingdoms, the Executive Council includes key figures like the Prime Minister, Defense Minister, and other high-ranking officials. They are responsible for executing the decisions of the House and managing day-to-day operations of the government.

### Key Positions

#### Crowns

Members of royal families from one of the ruling Kingdoms. Crowns vote on who sits the throne in their kingdom. Crowns typically assume leadership roles in kingdom government and enterprise.

#### Thrones

The acting head of a Kingdom. Thrones aren’t always the head of their Kingdom’s royal family, but they must be related by marriage, blood or bond.

#### Prime Minister

The head of the Executive Council and the most powerful position in URSA's administrative government. The Prime Minister is responsible for setting the political agenda, representing URSA in international matters, and ensuring the smooth functioning of the government.

#### Defense Minister

The Defense Minister plays a critical role in maintaining security and managing military affairs, including the unique challenges posed by the environmental aftermath of the Dark Decade. The Defense Minister’s responsibilities extend to include all matters of environment and climate.

#### Cultural Attaché

A unique position in URSA, Cultural Attachés are responsible for maintaining the cultural integrity and traditions of each kingdom within the super-state. They act as liaisons between the kingdoms and the central government, ensuring that policies are sensitive to cultural nuances.

### Functioning

#### **Decision-Making**

The House of Kingdoms is where major decisions are made. Each kingdom representative has a vote, and decisions are often reached through a mix of consensus and majority rule. The diversity of cultures and political ideologies in the House leads to dynamic and often complex negotiations.

#### **Law Enforcement & Justice**

Each kingdom has its autonomy in enforcing laws and administering justice, but they must adhere to the constitutional framework set by URSA. This leads to a varied legal landscape across the super-state, where local customs and traditions play a significant role in the judicial process.

#### **Economic and Environmental Policies**

Policies related to climate and economy are central, bringing in the interests of the Ministry of Defense. The government works to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability, often leading to debates between industrial and ecological priorities.

#### **Diplomatic Relations**

URSA maintains a delicate balance in international relations, particularly with GATA. Navigating their tense relationship with GATA, especially regarding mounting pressure to adopt The System, is a central aspect of URSA's diplomatic strategy.

URSA believes it should have a more prominent role in global governance than is afforded by the strictures of GATA, and its governance and economy are threatened by the regulations of the New Dawn Accords, which they have not officially signed. URSA often finds itself performing self-imposed adherence to the Accords to forestall or evade sanction by GATA.

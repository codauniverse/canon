#### Synopsis

2115\. Ten years ago. Bright Mesa celebrates its contentious vote to join GATA as its newest district. An Atlan delegation is on approach to mark the historic event. Among the delegates is the guest of honor, Kyote, local folk legend from the Dark Decade, who has come to perform for the city where his story began. The stage is now set, and it will be a show to remember.

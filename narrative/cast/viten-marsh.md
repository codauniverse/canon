## **Bio**

Viten was born in New York during the early years of the Reconstruction Era. His early life was shaped by the aftermath of the Dark Decade and the burgeoning promise of the New Dawn. Showing a remarkable aptitude for science and technology from a young age, Viten excelled in his studies at New York's Garden school and before the close of his first year, he was recruited into the capitol's Atlan Academy.&#x20;

There, his studies continued without constraint, and before long he had caught the eye of the Research Corps. His groundbreaking work in stabilizing smaller static nodes and static engines garnered him significant acclaim. Upon graduating from the High Academy at the age of 15, Viten was invited to join ALTAR's secret INSIGHT research project, dedicated to the study of the fabled Found Objects.

His years in this secretive ALTAR program transformed Viten from a researcher into a shrewd negotiator and far-seeing operator. When he resurfaced after his time with ALTAR, he co-founded Phasia Industries alongside Soraya Mata and Remi Tranche in the Greater Toronto district, chosen for its permissive paradigm.

Viten's professional life was marked by his relentless pursuit of innovation. Some say his work is single-handedly responsible for the commiodification of static field technology, a feat that propelled Phasia Industries to the forefront of GATA's innovation industry. However, his personal life was less fulfilling. Viten harbored unrequited feelings for Soraya, his co-founder and close collaborator. To avoid jeopardizing their professional relationship, Viten never confessed his feelings and outwardly encouraged Soraya to pursue her passions.

Soraya's subsequent relationship with the unserious folk musician Kyote dealt a crushing blow to Viten. Watching her find happiness with another while he remained alone deepened his sense of isolation, leading to a rift in their relationship. Shortly thereafter, Soraya left Phasia to start a family with Kyote.

In response, Viten moved Phasiaâ€™s operations to Atla, rebranding the enterprise as Relik and shifting focus towards partnerships with other other enterprises licensing advanced technologies. Today, Relik is involved in a wide range of research and commercial enterprises, as well as significant government contracts with institutions like the Second Quorum, Angelis, and Collections. In recent years, Viten has been most enwrapped in the advancement of ethical and compliant human cloning technologies in partnership with Akicel Technologies.

Viten remains a towering figure in the scientific community, both feared and respected for his intelligence and uncompromising drive.

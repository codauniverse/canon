## Bio

Carlos was born in Mexico City, the de facto Capital City of the Texan Empire. His parents emigrated to Bright Mesa when he was young, and he was awed by the fruits of the Reconstruction in creating that desert metropolis, its shimmering towers, its vast underground complexes, and its geo-engineered oasis.

At the age of 12 Carlos had decided he wanted to grow up to be an Operator, navigating The System for clients. His parents had instilled in him an idealized image of GATA. saw the Greater California System core attacked by an AI deployed across the district by Free Territory insurgents. This experience and the highly publicized attack inspired him to pursue a career in law enforcement investigating and preventing the illegal use of dangerous AIs.

At 18 he joined the GATA Intelligence Academy specifically to study the types of 21st century systems used predominately by the Free Territories.

He would graduate with full honors. Carlos took naturally to on-the-ground investigation, possessing a sixth sense for the presence of contraband technology. With his restrained but decisive style, Carlos has gone on to contribute to a number of successful high profile investigations for the AICâ€™s Emergency Special Committee. He now primarily works multi-district investigations at the direct disposal of the AICâ€™s high council.

Wherever he goes, he brings his Manna plant, grown in the soil of his childhood home, a reminder of a place to which he can never return. Heâ€™s remarkably detail oriented and observant. Polite, but not sociable. While heâ€™s not long for conversation, he does occasionally quip to himself under his breath, and talks openly to his plant.

## **Bio**

Sasha Cache was born just outside of London, a city resurrected from the ashes of the Dark Decade into a bustling hub of trade after being districted by GATA in the later years of the Reconstruction.

Her parents, small-time shopkeepers in Dagenham, struggled to make ends meet, but Sasha had bigger dreams. From a young age, she was stifled by the smallness of her world determined to escape her humble home and climb the social ladder to the glittering heights of Atlaâ€™s gleaming towers.

Sasha's climb began in London's underground party scene, where her knack for connecting with influential figures became apparent. She navigated the labyrinthine causeways connecting the underground to the pinnacles of London's high society with ease, using her charm and wits to secure invitations to the most exclusive events. Her natural flair for fashion and keen eye for trends soon made her a sought-after taste-maker.

Despite her success, Sasha found the barriers of class in GATA's society difficult to overcome. The keys to Atla, with their promise of ultimate privilege and power, remained consistently out of reach. This fueled her relentless drive and led her to form relationships with various unsavory characters. Whether it was leveraging information, trading secrets, or occasionally blackmail, Sasha was unafraid to use every tool at her disposal.

Her ambition, however, came with a cost. The high-stakes game of social climbing was a constant balancing act, and Sasha had to carefully manage her image and connections. She indulged in the hedonistic pleasures of elite parties, often losing herself in the wild revelries that served as both a distraction and a reminder of what she still had to gain.

With the growing popularity of sync raves in the underground scene across GATA, Sasha has taken note of the trend, believing that her experience in the gutter will allow her to bring the best of these sync raves to Atla's high society, and secure her foothold in Atla.

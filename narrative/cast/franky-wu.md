## Bio

Franky is the energetic, self-assured lovechild of two successful engineers. He was born and raised in the Greater Toronto district, and heâ€™s never left.

From a very young age, Franky was fascinated by the incredible feats of conduits throughout the district, erecting megastructures and transforming the environment with only their minds.

A natural conduit, Franky had hoped to follow in his parents footsteps but he was never as gifted with the technical details, and has always had a great deal of difficulty staying focused. However, after his first time seeing the sights and sounds of an arcade, he found a singular focus for the first time in his life: his calling was experience design.

At 16 he developed his own DIY emitter setup and would dazzle and annoy everyone in his life with his overwhelming displays of reactive light, form and color. Of course, he didn't need the emitters to make his presence known; Franky has always been rambunctious, opinionated, and outspoken.

Ambitious and entrepreneurial, he has started working with local small enterprises to level up their storefronts and interior spaces; he'd gladly work for anyone who will let him do what he loves mostâ€”as long as he can do it his way.

But it's all just been practice so far. As far as Franky's concerned, he's just biding his time until he turns 18 and he can get a job at the arcade where finally he'll be able to do his thing for an audience that is ready, willing, and able, to have their minds blown.

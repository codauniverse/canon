## Bio

Born in Tehran, Haleh’s family worked in the provisional government during URSA's failed signing of the New Dawn Accords (NDA). Accusations from various Kingdoms of corrupt government officials spurred political violence against families with political ties, driving her parents to attempt to flee for asylum in GATA when she was 7. Her father was executed the morning they fled, and her mother did not survive the journey to the GATA refugee camp in Istanbul. The young Haleh was rescued by Angelis.

She was placed in the East Garden, a campus for orphaned children on the east side of the Bosphorus Strait, and was enrolled in the Atlan Academy. While she was in Istanbul, there was heavy Aryabat industrial presence due to ongoing Reconstruction efforts, and she was surrounded by conduits using a state of the art technology called links to control massive machines with their mind. After showing an interest, an observant teacher encouraged Haleh to join in on a link workshop session for students.

Her aptitude with the link was immediately apparent. Because the district of Istanbul didn’t have links in their paradigm, Haleh was recommended for transfer to the Greater Toronto district, where links were recently paradigmed. After a year in Istanbul, 8 year-old Haleh was relocated across the world.

She had a lonely childhood in Greater Toronto, having difficulty relating to the other children. She enjoyed playing alone in the Manna gardens and dancing to the music in the square, but she struggled making friends. By the age of 10, Haleh had taken to escaping into 21st century art and fiction and especially music, which helped her discover her synesthesia–her strong sense of form and color and motion when she listens intently to music.

By the age of 13 she was already making music of her own, inspired heavily by the electronic synth sounds of the early and mid 2000s, loving granular synths and rich, layered sounds. It was only natural that she would learn how to use her talents with a link to enhance her music over the following years, and later, when syncraves appeared, she was perfectly positioned to break onto the scene under the stage name SOULJOURNER.

Since then, she’s become a sensation in Toronto’s underground syncrave scene, a syncjockey known for her uncanny ability to sense and guide ‘the vibe’. Her childhood habit of dancing while she plays her instruments has evolved into a striking stage presence.

Find her hunting antique 21st century music and hardware, planning and practicing for her next show, or tending to the Manna flowers in Greater Toronto's waterfront Garden.

Quotes

> "I used to fall asleep fantasizing about travelling the world, you know? Playing music for cheering crowds. Now I pass out when my head hits the pillow, and I wake up wondering if I ever had a dream at all." - Haleh

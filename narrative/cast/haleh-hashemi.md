## Bio

Born in Tehran, Haleh‚Äôs family worked in the provisional government during URSA's failed signing of the New Dawn Accords (NDA) and the subsequent [Pulling of the Weeds](../../world/ursa/history/the-pulling-of-the-weeds.md). Accusations of corruption spurred political violence against families with certain political ties, driving her parents to attempt to flee for asylum in GATA when she was 2. Her father was executed the morning they fled, and her mother did not survive the journey to the GATA refugee camp in Istanbul. The infant Haleh was rescued by Angelis.

She was placed in the East Garden, a community-run campus for orphaned children on the east side of the Bosphorus Strait, and was primarily looked over by an older woman who worked in the Garden. When she was 5, she was enrolled in the Atlan Academy. While she was in Istanbul, there was heavy Aryabat industrial presence due to ongoing Reconstruction efforts, and she was surrounded by conduits using a state of the art technology called links to control massive machines with their mind. After showing an interest, the woman who cared for her encouraged Haleh to join in on a link workshop session for students.

Her aptitude with the link was immediately apparent. Because the district of Istanbul didn‚Äôt have links in their paradigm, Haleh was recommended for transfer to the Greater Toronto district, where links were recently paradigmed. After six years in Istanbul, 8 year-old Haleh was relocated across the world, and away from the only family she had known.

She had a lonely childhood in Greater Toronto, having difficulty relating to the other children. She enjoyed playing alone in the Manna gardens and dancing to the music in the square, but she struggled making friends. By the age of 10, Haleh had taken to escaping into 21st century art and fiction and especially music, which helped her discover her synesthesia‚Äìher strong sense of form and color and motion when she listens intently to music.

By the age of 13 she was already making music of her own, inspired heavily by the electronic synth sounds of the early and mid 2000s, loving granular synths and rich, layered sounds. It was only natural that she would learn how to use her talents with a link to enhance her music over the following years, and later, when syncraves appeared, she was perfectly positioned to break onto the scene under the stage name SOULJOURNER.

Since then, she‚Äôs become a sensation in Toronto‚Äôs underground syncrave scene, a syncjockey known for her uncanny ability to sense and guide ‚Äòthe vibe‚Äô. Her childhood habit of dancing while she plays her instruments has evolved into a striking stage presence.

Find her hunting antique 21st century music and hardware, wall-flowering at a sync rave, planning and practicing for her next show, or tending to the Manna flowers in Greater Toronto's waterfront Garden.

> "I don‚Äôt know who I am when I‚Äôm not performing. I find myself there, when I‚Äôm pressed up against everyone that I‚Äôm not. Like, a contour of something...‚Äù - Haleh

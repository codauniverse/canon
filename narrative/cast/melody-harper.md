## **Bio**

Melody, born in Cascadia, a Free Territory, came into the world afflicted with a congenital genetic disease that was not treatable by Manna-based medicines. By the age of three, Melody had begun suffering from increasingly violent spasms and seizures, driving her mother, a GATA citizen, to seek treatment for her daughter in GATA's LA district.

Unfortunately, young Melody's condition continued to deteriorate and the only hope to stem its progression was to carefully monitor and control her metabolism and plasma. As a result, she spent much of her life as a ‚Äúsleeper,‚Äù bedridden and engrossed in virtual constructs for stimulation.

Despite her physical limitations, Melody had a loving upbringing and excelled academically, particularly in history, and possessed a beautiful singing voice, a gift she inherited from her musical mother. Meanwhile, "on the other side", she had formed many deep friendships with other sleepers across the district, and it was from them that she learned about the Astral.

With the help of her mother, Melody acquired the newly paradigmed empatherapy machine using her disability assistance keys. Demonstrating her ingenuity and determination, she secretly jailbroke the unit herself, learning just enough LMNL to get the job done. Within a week of obtaining the template from an unknown source, she had a functioning astral node.

In short order Melody became one of the earliest power users of the Astral, finally freed to experience the many sensations of life that had eluded her, and many more beyond the imagination of the waking world. She spent significant time orienting new astral travelers and helping them navigate the ever-transforming expanse. Her most notable creation was the Crystal Tower, a beacon that to this day guides lost travelers and serves as a popular meeting point. The Tower remains one of the astral's most iconic constructs.

It was only a matter of time before her disease reached her brainstem. Melody succumbed to complications from her condition, and the impact of her loss was deeply felt across the Astral community. A funeral was held in the astral in her honor, attended by many friends and followers.

Some claim to still see her in the astral on occasion, a spectral figure on the balcony of the Crystal Tower, but whenever they investigate, she is nowhere to be found.

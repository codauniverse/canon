## Bio

Born in Nairobi in 2097. Son of famous Dark Decade folk hero, Kyote, and pioneering technologist Soraya Mata.

His family moved to Atla when he was 2. His celebrity father and research obsessed mother struggled to strike a balance between their worlds. At 6 he was enrolled in the Atlan Junior Academy. When he was 8 his mother had to move back to the AU for work, and his father spent most of his time on tour so Prince learned how to be alone. Prince stayed close with his mother by sending her code to fix.

When he was 13, Prince was expelled from the Atlan Academy of the Arts due to repeated breaches of security. He moved to Greater Toronto, where his father was based. Spending more time with his father, Prince became fascinated with music and, during a trip to LA for a performance, glimpsed the emerging sync scene forming around the newly paradigmed tech. He also began to see how GATA used his father, and saw his father‚Äôs sympathy for the Free Territories. One day, Prince was jamming in his father‚Äôs studio when GATA‚Äôs visiting Councilor for the Arts noted Prince‚Äôs talent and suggested one day he might perform for GATA.

After an argument with his father about moving to live with his mother, Prince stormed off on his dart board and, while spying from a roof, he spotted a young girl driving a very complex system with her link in a secluded area, and he would soon befriend her, realizing they both attended the same school. After learning about music and syncing from Haleh, Prince finally revealed to her that he was his father‚Äôs son. She already knew, but he could tell that she acted surprised for him. Eventually he revealed that he had to move to live with his mother, putting a premature end to their budding crush.

At the age of 15, Prince traveled with his father to meet his mother at his big Bright Mesa performance. The intention was that he would go home with his mother after the show. Tragically, there was a terrorist attack during the GATA-sponsored performance in Bright Mesa targeting Atlan dignitaries. His mother and father were killed. Prince was believed to have been killed in the attack.

He turns up 10 years later.

## Meta Self-Description

I don't want people to know me. I don't want praise. I don't want friends. My life was traded in for a purpose a long time ago. My parents were both important to The System, my father the folk legend, Kyote, and my mother, Soraya, a brilliant technologist. I grew up aspiring to be a great coder, but I learned at a young age, this world doesn't want to suffer the cost of creativity. When my parents died, I was stranded in the Free Territories and learned how to survive in a harsh reality. Got it?

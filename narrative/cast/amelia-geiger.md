## Bio

Amelia is a prodigy programmer from the former Free Territory of Ireland. She was born after Reconstruction just a few years before Ireland was incorporated into GATA, and she grew up in a political climate that was warming to benefits of GATA membership.

Her parents were strongly against the GATA incorporation, and had organized passionately against the prior GATA occupation, a sentiment born from the fact that Ireland had fared relatively well through the Dark Decade and Reconstruction. Her parents' stance toward GATA colored Ameliaâ€™s early outlook on GATA, but her brotherâ€™s optimism about the opportunities created by GATA always struck her.

After being invited into a GATA summer program for gifted youth, she catapulted to the top of her cohort. She was invited to the Atlan Academy of Science and her curiosity overpowered her misgivings.

Her specialization in cog design developed into a whitepaper on cog safety protocols. Less interested in the architecture, she was interested in the kinds of minds that different structures produce. While she had been hoping to be invited to ALTAR this work earned her an unexpected and prestigious AIC contract to study and assess the safety of KYO Technologyâ€™s CODA.

## Motivations

* Learn as much as she can from her assignments
* Perform a perfect audit for the AIC
* Experience big city life
* Curious about everything to do with links

## Trivia

* She can calculate almost any sum in her head, without use of a link.
* Her imagination is very visual-spatial, and she sees numbers and equations like shapes that fit together.

* Addicted to praise.
* Is easily goaded into proving her competence.
* Chews on her pens and pencils.

## Secrets

* Frustrated that her rising career is taking her away from the topics that interest her most.
* Wants to try syncing.

## Skills

* Specialized in cog safety and ontology design.
* Novice link user, but does show some notable aptitude for starting so old.

## Bio

Born in Paris at the outset of the Reconstruction era, Remi Maeda is the son of a Japanese refugee and a French translator. His early life was steeped in the complexities of a world in recovery. Showing an early aptitude for science and technology, he was enrolled in the newly established Atlan Academy in Paris, where he focused on Asimovian architecture, inspired by the work of a little-known Soraya Mata, an older student enrolled in the capitol's High Academy.

Remi's groundbreaking research hinted at a revolutionary 5-dimensional approach to filter design, but the computational demands far exceeded what the fledgling AIC deemed safe. Recognized for his genius, he was recruited into ALTARâ€™s INSIGHT program at just 15, where he was paired with Soraya Mata and Viten Marsh. When the three finished their contract with ALTAR, they decided to form a private enterprise named Phasia.

Seven years later, spurred by Soraya's sudden departure from Phasia, Remi took advantage of the many keys he had earned to move to Japan and finally reunite with his long lost mother and sister. It was here that he would make a discovery that would change his life. His sister was dying of Rejection, an incurable disease that had rendered her bed-ridden and very weak. As her health declined, Remi desperately wanted to help her.

He jailbroke an empatherapy sync hub in hopes to somehow connect with her, the sister he had never known. This led to his revelation that with precise calibration, a pusher could create shared dream spaces, allowing for an entirely new class of construct, existing entirely within the minds of the users.

Following his sisterâ€™s death, Remi refined his techniques with a little guidance from Soraya and, defiantly published the LMNL plans that would allow anyone to â€˜jailbreakâ€™ sync hubs as he had, an act that eventually led to his arrest by Japanese authorities. Now living in a gilded cage, he spends his days roaming his walled garden prison as an admin, condemned to atone for, and mitigate, the consequences of his actions.

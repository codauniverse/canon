## **Bio**

Soraya Mata was born into a turbulent Nairobi in 2061, during a period of political upheaval as political lines were redrawn with the African Union's controversial decision to sign GATA's New Dawn Accords. The resultant riots claimed the lives of her parents, leaving her an orphan by the age of 8. Her father, a community representative, was executed by AFRX separatists, and her mother perished during a terrorist attack known as the Night of Falling Stars.

Soraya was subsequently placed under state care and, although she was a difficult child with little respect for authority, she quickly demonstrated a prodigious aptitude for technology. At the age of 15, Soraya was offered a position as an exchange student in Atla's High Academy. By 17, she had developed LMNL, the first Asimovian framework capable of compiling NDA-compliant physical functions, revolutionizing information safety. Her studies culminated in the creation of the first LMNL-based filter nodes, marking a significant milestone in the development of secure computational systems.

Her talents caught the attention of ALTAR, a prestigious Atlan institution, in part thanks to an anonymous recommendation. There, she was grouped with Remi Tranche and Viten Marsh to study Found Objects, mysterious artifacts of unknown origin. After their secretive contracts concluded, the three friends founded Phasia, pioneering new approaches to securing and scaling various technologies. However, differing visions for the future of Phasia led to Soraya leaving the highly successful organization, and founding KYO Technologies in Greater Toronto.

Soraya married Kyote, a celebrated folk musician, and the couple had a son named Prince. Their whirlwind romance was by all means the happiest time in her life. However, it wasn't long before she found herself once again consumed in her work. Her relentless pursuits often strained her family life, culminating in a separation when she chose to continue her research in the AU where the paradigms were much less restrictive. To help her balance every area of her life, she built a custom cog named AIDA, an assistant based on her own personality.

Despite her groundbreaking achievements, Soraya's life ended in the terror attack that devastated Bright Mesa. The attack also killed her husband, Kyote, and had been targeting Atlan delegates who had been in Bright Mesa to celebrate its districthood. Soraya's legacy lives on through her contributions to the technological landscape, and the lingering mysteries of her final projects.

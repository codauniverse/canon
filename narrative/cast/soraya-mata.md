## **Bio**

Soraya Mata was born into a turbulent Nairobi in 2061, during a period of political upheaval as political lines were redrawn following the African Union's controversial decision to sign GATA's New Dawn Accords. The resultant riots claimed the lives of her parents, leaving her an orphan at the age of 8. Her father, a community representative, was executed by AFRX separatists, and her mother perished during a terrorist attack known as the Night of Falling Stars.

Soraya was subsequently placed under state care and, although she was a difficult child with little respect for authority, she quickly demonstrated a prodigious aptitude for technology. At the age of 15, Soraya was offered a position as an exchange student in Atla's High Academy. She had a knack for drawing powerful insights from observing natural systems.

At the age of 17, inspired in part by mycelial networks, she developed an early version of LMNL, the first Asimovian framework capable of compiling directly to NDA-compliant physical functions. LMNL would go on to redefine information safety across GATA. Her studies culminated in the creation of the first LMNL-based filter nodes, marking a significant milestone in the development of secure computational systems, and earned her an enterprise license.

Her talents caught the attention of ALTAR, a prestigious Atlan institution, in part thanks to an anonymous recommendation. She was invited to join ALTAR's INSIGHT program where she was grouped with Remi Tranche and Viten Marsh to study Found Objects, mysterious artifacts of unknown origin. After their secretive contracts concluded, the three friends founded Phasia, pioneering new approaches to securing and scaling various technologies. However, differing visions for the future of Phasia led to Soraya leaving the highly successful organization, and founding KYO Technologies in Greater Toronto.

Soraya married Kyote, a celebrated folk musician, and the couple had a son named Prince. Their whirlwind romance was by all means the happiest time in her life. However, it wasn't long before she found herself once again consumed in her work. Her relentless pursuits often strained her family life, culminating in a separation when she chose to continue her research in the AU where the paradigms were much less restrictive. To help her balance every area of her life, she built a cog she named Aida, an assistant based on her own personality, compiled from custom hardcode distinct from LMNL.

Despite her groundbreaking achievements, Soraya's life ended in the terror attack that devastated Bright Mesa in 2115. The attack also killed her husband, Kyote, and had been targeting Atlan delegates who had been in Bright Mesa to celebrate its districthood. Soraya's legacy lives on through her contributions to the technological landscape, and the lingering mysteries of her final projects.

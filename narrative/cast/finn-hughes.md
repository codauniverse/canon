## **Bio**

Finn's early life was difficult. Orphaned at a young age, he grew up in a refugee camp in Louisiana, part of Atla's early efforts to restore order across continental America. His natural leadership and conflict resolution skills caught the attention of Atlan military recruiters. Excelling in sports and academics, he was soon transferred to a military training camp, where his genetic compatibility with the Research Corp's Project Clear was discovered. This secretive program aimed to develop super-soldiers.

Finn's performance in the program was exceptional. Despite being offered a position in the prestigious Maverick program, he chose to join the Rapid Response team, valuing the opportunity to help others in crises over the combat-focused Maverick role. His decision was influenced by his innate belief in the goodness of people.

Finn's many deployment to crisis zones and natural disasters made him a legendary figure within Rapid Response. His remarkable ability to remain calm under pressure and lead rescue operations earned him the respect and admiration of his peers. Despite his extensive career spanning several decades, the Clear therapy slowed his body's aging, causing him to appear perpetually 20 years old.

Tragically, Finn's life ended during the Bright Mesa terrorist attack, where he heroically confronted and defeated the terrorist known as the Butcher of Bright Mesa. His sacrifice doubtlessly saved countless lives, cementing his legacy as the greatest Rapid Response operative in history.

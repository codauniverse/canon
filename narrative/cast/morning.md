## Bio

Morning was born into a prominent Lakota family within the Church of the Sky, a powerful hybrid religious organization formed during the Dark Decade. Their father, a revered preacher, and their mother, a devout follower, expected Morning to uphold the family's legacy.

From a young age, Morning was deeply involved in the Church's activities, displaying a devout faith. This changed at age 13, when they witnessed their father making a shameful deal with a high-ranking GATA official, diverting church funds for personal gain. This betrayal shattered Morning's faith, replacing it with a belief in human greed as the true driving force.

Despite being poised to inherit the Church's leadership, Morning is skeptical of its doctrines. They focus instead on building a network of informants across GATA and the Free Territories, collecting secrets and compromising material to use as leverage when leadership of the Church falls to them.

## Meta Self-Description

Iâ€™m not here to lead with faith or inspire with doctrine. My world is built on secrets and leverage. The Church may see me as their future, but I see myself as the master of their greed. Growing up in a family of devout leaders, I learned early on that belief is a faÃ§ade. What drives people is much simpler â€“ and far more exploitable.

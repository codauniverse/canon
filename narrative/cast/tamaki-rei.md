## Bio

Tamaki was born in Sendai, in the North of New Imperial Japan.

Raised by her widowed half-European mother, who later married her step-father when she was 12. Tamaki was always a bright and talented child, however navigating the attention her good looks brought her was difficult. Her step father insisted she perform as a way to be seen in society, so that her beauty could bring her a good husband. She didn't want to sing and dance, she wanted to run, but her speed could not keep up with her beauty.

She was discovered by an Atlan Councillor for the Arts visiting from Atla during a cultural exchange. 17 year old Tamaki performed with a group of girls but her looks and attitude beamed from the stage.

Thanks to her dual citizenship, there were no road blocks to Tamaki travelling to perform outside of New Imperial Japan as a GATA-sponsored artist. In only a few short days, her life was transformed. But she'd have to leave her group behind.

For the last decade, Tamaki's star has risen, and she has become the biggest music superstar in GATA. Her stage show is a huge production, and she is always surrounded by handlers and assistants. She's adapted to find her calm in the storm by settling on a goal. Some conquest. And she will not be denied, as she's all but forgotten what the word "no" even sounds like.

## Bio

Morning was born into a prominent Lakota family within the Church of the Sky, a powerful religious organization formed during the Dark Decade. Their father, a revered preacher, and their mother, a devout follower, expected Morning to uphold the family's legacy.

From a young age, the winkte Morning was deeply involved in the Church's activities, displaying a devout faith, and showing an deep understanding of both traditional Lakota teachings and the blended doctrines of the Church of the Sky. This early dedication won them many admirers within the congregation.

This changed at age 13, when they witnessed their father making a corrupt arrangement with a GATA representative, diverting church funds for personal gain and political advantage.

The realization that their father, a revered spiritual leader, could be so easily corrupted by greed and power deeply affected Morning. This disillusionment shattered Morning's faith, replacing it with a belief in human greed as the true driving force, and led to a gradual withdrawal from active participation in the Churchâ€™s communal life.

As their faith in the Church's teachings waned, Morning's belief in human greed and manipulation grew. They began to see the Church not as a spiritual sanctuary but as a tool for power and influence. This shift in perspective drove them to build a network of informants across the Free Territories, collecting secrets and compromising material to use as leverage.

Morning has several siblings, each with distinct personalities and more devout involvement in the Church's day-to-day functioning. They have a particular soft spot for their youngest sister, who shared in Morningâ€™s games and mischief growing up. However, since her marriage to another prominent figure in the Church, their relationship has become strained. This isolation has exacerbated Morning's antipathy towards others.

Despite being poised to inherit the Church's leadership, Morning remains detached from its doctrines. They focus instead on building a network of informants across GATA and the Free Territories, collecting secrets and compromising material to use as leverage when leadership of the Church falls to them.

## Meta Self-Description

Iâ€™m not here to lead with faith or inspire with doctrine. My world is built on secrets and leverage. The Church may see me as their future, but I see myself as the master of their greed. Growing up in a family of devout leaders, I learned early on that belief is a faÃ§ade. What drives people is much simpler â€“ and far more exploitable.
